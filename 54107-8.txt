PREFACE.


The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly depend
upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter into its service
are animated, and consequently it is of the highest importance that
any measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation, by which
alone great and gallant actions are achieved, should be adopted.

Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this desirable
object, than a full display of the noble deeds with which the
Military History of our country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those who have
preceded him in their honourable career, are among the motives that
have given rise to the present publication.

The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced in the
"London Gazette," from whence they are transferred into the public
prints: the achievements of our armies are thus made known at the
time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute of praise and
admiration to which they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions,
the Houses of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on
the Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under their
orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for their skill
and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by the high honour
of their Sovereign's Approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.

It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental armies)
for British Regiments to keep regular records of their services
and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been experienced in
obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.

This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His Majesty
having been pleased to command, that every Regiment shall in future
keep a full and ample record of its services at home and abroad.

From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations which
chequer the career of those who embrace the military profession. In
Great Britain, where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and
where these pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed
by the _presence of war_, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even during
peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part of the globe,
with little or no interval of repose.

In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the country
derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed not often to
reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,--on
their sufferings,--and on the sacrifice of valuable life, by which
so many national benefits are obtained and preserved.

The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties; and
their character has been established in Continental warfare by the
irresistible spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the gallantry and
steadiness with which they have maintained their advantages against
superior numbers.

In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders, ample
justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions of the
Corps employed; but the details of their services, and of acts of
individual bravery, can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.

These Records are now preparing for publication, under His
Majesty's special authority, by Mr. RICHARD CANNON, Principal Clerk
of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while the perusal of them
cannot fail to be useful and interesting to military men of every
rank, it is considered that they will also afford entertainment and
information to the general reader, particularly to those who may
have served in the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.

There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served,
or are serving, in the Army, an _Esprit de Corps_--an attachment
to every thing belonging to their Regiment; to such persons a
narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of the great,--the
valiant,--the loyal, have always been of paramount interest with
a brave and civilized people. Great Britain has produced a race
of heroes who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood, "firm
as the rocks of their native shore;" and when half the World has
been arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,--victories so complete and surprising, gained
by our countrymen,--our brothers,--our fellow-citizens in arms,--a
record which revives the memory of the brave, and brings their
gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove acceptable to the
public.

Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their respective

[Sidenote: 1685]

In the summer of 1685 England was in a state of tranquillity; the
minds of men were not, however, at ease respecting the religion
of their king, James II., but they put the best construction on
his conduct, and manufactures and commerce were flourishing;
when suddenly James Duke of Monmouth invaded the western shores
with a few followers, and asserted his claim to the sovereignty
of the realm. The din of hostile preparation instantly resounded
throughout the kingdom, and thousands of His Majesty's subjects
laid aside the pursuits of industry, and arrayed themselves under
the royal standard, to oppose the invader and his adherents. At
this juncture SIR EDWARD HALES, Baronet, of Woodchurch, in the
county of Kent, stood forward in the support of the Crown, and
raised a company of one hundred musketeers and pikemen, for the
king's service, at Canterbury and in its vicinity. Companies were
also raised by the following loyal gentlemen:-- ---- Boynton, Esq.,
Robert Middleton, Henry Vaughan, Richard Brewer[1], William Broom,
John Gifford, Thomas Gifford, Mark Talbot, John Chappell, and
Rowland Watson, and these companies were constituted a regiment,
of which SIR EDWARD HALES was appointed colonel, ---- Boynton
lieutenant-colonel, and Robert Middleton major, by commissions
dated the 22nd of June, 1685; and the corps thus formed now
bears the title of the FOURTEENTH REGIMENT OF FOOT. The general
rendezvous of the regiment was at Canterbury; two companies
had their rendezvous at Rochester and Chatham, and others at
Sittingbourne and Feversham.

While the formation of the regiment was in progress, the rebel army
was defeated at Sedgemoor, and the Duke of Monmouth was captured
and beheaded. SIR EDWARD HALES'S regiment was, however, one of
the corps which the King resolved to retain in his service; the
establishment was fixed at ten companies of sixty men each, and in
the middle of August the regiment was encamped on Hounslow-heath,
where it was reviewed by His Majesty; it afterwards marched to
Gravesend and Tilbury, detaching two companies to Jersey, one to
Guernsey, and two to Windsor.

[Sidenote: 1687]

The regiment was again encamped on Hounslow-heath in the summer of
1687, and a grenadier company was added to its establishment. At
this period the following officers were holding commissions in the
regiment, viz.:--

       _Captains._             _Lieutenants._        _Ensigns._
  Sir Edw. Hales, (_Col._)   Thomas Butler         Dudley Van Burgh
  G. Barclay, (_Lt.-Col._)   Robert Seaton         Austin Belson
  John Gifford, (_Major_)    Richard Boucher       Thomas Heyward

  _Chaplain_, Nicholas Trapps.--_Adjutant_, James Nicholson.
  _Chirurgeon_, John Ridley.--_Quarter-Master_, Edward Syng.

After passing in review before the King and Queen, and other
members of the royal family, the regiment struck its tents and
marched to Plymouth, where it was stationed during the winter.

[Sidenote: 1688]

From Plymouth the regiment marched to London in June, 1688, and
took the duty at the Tower until the middle of August, when it was
relieved by the Royal Fusiliers, and marched to Canterbury, and in
September to Salisbury.

In the mean time the measures adopted by King James II. to
establish Papacy and arbitrary government had filled the country
with alarm. Among other proceedings the King claimed the power
of dispensing with the oaths, required by law, on appointment to
office; the colonel of the FOURTEENTH Regiment, SIR EDWARD HALES,
had espoused the Roman Catholic religion; he, therefore, could
not take the oaths, and was not eligible for his commission; he
was prosecuted and convicted at Rochester assizes; but he moved
the case into the Court of the King's Bench, and had judgment
in his behalf; eleven of the twelve judges taking part with the
King against the law. Many of the nobility solicited the Prince
of Orange to aid them in opposing the measures of the court, and
when the Prince arrived with a Dutch army, the King assembled his
forces at Salisbury. The result may be told in a few words:--the
English army refused to fight in the cause of Papacy and arbitrary
government; the King, accompanied by Colonel Sir Edward Hales,
and Quarter-Master Edward Syng, of this regiment, attempted to
escape to France in disguise; but they were apprehended on board
of a Custom-house vessel at Feversham, and Sir Edward Hales was
afterwards confined in the Tower of London. The King made a second
attempt, and arrived in France in safety. The Prince of Orange
issued orders for the regiment to occupy quarters at Waltham, in
Hampshire, and conferred the colonelcy on William Beveridge, an
officer of the English brigade in the Dutch service, by commission
dated the 31st of December, 1688.

[Sidenote: 1689]

The accession of William Prince of Orange and his consort to the
throne was opposed in Scotland, and in the spring of 1689 the
regiment was ordered to march towards the north; it was stationed
a short time at Berwick, where it was inspected on the 14th of
June by the commissioners for re-modelling the army: in August it
received orders to march to Edinburgh.

[Sidenote: 1690]

[Sidenote: 1691]

The regiment was employed in various services in Scotland and
the north of England until the insurgent clans had lost all hope
of success, and in 1691 they tendered their submission to the
government of King William III.

[Sidenote: 1692]

In the spring of 1692, the regiment embarked for Flanders, to
take part in the war in which the British monarch was engaged, to
preserve the liberties of Europe against the ambitious projects of
the court of France. Scarcely had it arrived at the seat of war,
and taken post in one of the fortified towns of West Flanders, when
the French monarch assembled his army near La Hogue, and prepared a
fleet to convey the troops to England, for the purpose of replacing
King James on the throne. The regiment was immediately ordered to
return, and having landed at Greenwich in the early part of May, it
was held in readiness to repel the invaders, should they venture to
land on the British shores; but while the menace of invasion was
producing considerable alarm in England, the French fleet sustained
a decisive defeat off La Hogue, and the danger instantly vanished:
the hopes of the Jacobites were frustrated, and the ascendancy of
Protestant principles insured. The regiment was afterwards encamped
near Portsmouth, and it formed part of an expedition under the
Duke of Leinster, afterwards Duke Schomberg, against the coast of
France; but the French naval force having been nearly annihilated
at the sea-fight off La Hogue, Louis XIV. expected a descent, and
had drawn so many troops from the interior to the coast, that the
Duke of Leinster did not venture to land. After menacing the French
shores at several points, to produce a diversion in favour of the
confederate army in the Netherlands, the fleet sailed to the Downs,
from whence it proceeded to Ostend, where the troops landed: they
took possession of and fortified the towns of Furnes and Dixmude,
and several regiments afterwards returned to England.

On the 14th of November Colonel William Beveridge was killed in
a duel with one of the captains; and King William afterwards
conferred the colonelcy of the regiment on Lieutenant-Colonel John
Tidcomb, from the Thirteenth Foot.

[Sidenote: 1693]

The FOURTEENTH was one of the regiments which remained in Flanders,
and it took the field in May, 1693, to serve the campaign of that
year with the confederate army, commanded by King William in
person, who took possession of the camp at Parck, near Louvain, to
prevent the designs of Louis XIV. on Brabant.

After taking part in several movements, the regiment was in
position at _Landen_, on the morning of the 19th of July, when
the French army, of very superior numbers, commanded by Marshal
Luxembourg, advanced to attack the forces under King William. On
this occasion the FOURTEENTH Regiment had its first opportunity of
proving its prowess in action with the enemy, and it gave presage
of that gallantry for which it afterwards became distinguished. The
French commenced the action with great spirit, but were repulsed
several times; their superior numbers enabled them to bring
forward fresh troops, and they eventually carried the village of
Neer-Winden. The King ordered a retreat, which was executed with
difficulty, and was attended with serious loss.

The FOURTEENTH Regiment had Captains Van Burgh, Cassin, and
Henriosa, and Lieutenant Worley, killed; Lieutenant Nicholson
died of his wounds; Captains Devaux and Stanwix, Lieutenants
Campbell, Forbes, and Pettitpiere, Ensigns Revison and Perrott,
wounded; Lieutenant-Colonel Graham taken prisoner: the number of
non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the regiment, killed and
wounded, has not been ascertained.

In the autumn, when the army separated for winter quarters, the
regiment marched into garrison at Bruges; at the same time parties
were sent to England to procure recruits, to replace the losses
sustained during this campaign.

[Sidenote: 1694]

When the army took the field in the spring of 1694, the regiment
was left, with several other corps, under Brigadier-General Sir
David Collier, encamped near Ghent, to form a guard for the
artillery, which was conveyed by water to Malines. The regiment
joined the army at the camp near Louvain, on the 4th of June, and
on the 6th it was reviewed by His Majesty, who was pleased to
express to Colonel Tidcomb his high approbation of its appearance.
The regiment was afterwards employed in several movements, and
it formed part of the splendid body of troops encamped at Mont
St. André, near the village of Ramilies, where the forces of the
confederate states were assembled under King William III., and
presented a magnificent spectacle of war.

The FOURTEENTH was one of the corps which attempted, by a forced
march, to pass the enemy's fortified lines, and penetrate French
Flanders; but by extraordinary exertions the French gained the
pass first, and thus preserved their country from an invasion.
The regiment was subsequently encamped near _Rousselaer_, forming
part of the covering army during the siege of _Huy_. The vicinity
of the camp was infested by detachments of the enemy, and on one
occasion the waggons conveying the bread to the army were attacked,
when a detachment of the FOURTEENTH, forming part of the guard, was
engaged, and the regiment had Captain Sacheverel mortally wounded,
who was the only British officer killed by the enemy during this
campaign.

Having to remain in the field during cold and wet weather, the
soldiers erected huts of wood and straw, and on the 1st of October
the huts of the FOURTEENTH Regiment were accidentally set on
fire, and destroyed: the Second Foot Guards had experienced the
same misfortune a few days previously. The fortress of Huy having
surrendered, the army separated for winter quarters, and the
regiment returned to Bruges in the second week in October.

[Sidenote: 1695]

From Bruges, the regiment marched, in May, 1695, to Dixmude,
where it pitched its tents, and remained several days. The Duke
of Wirtemberg took the command of the troops assembled at this
point, and advancing to the junction of the Loo and Dixmude canals,
encamped before the fortress of _Kenoque_, upon which an attack
was made for the purpose of drawing the French army that way, for
the protection of their lines in West Flanders. The FOURTEENTH
Regiment took part in this service; its grenadier company was
engaged in driving the French from the intrenchments and houses
near the Loo canal, and in repulsing the attempts of the enemy to
regain possession of them. A redoubt was afterwards taken, and a
lodgment effected in the works at the bridge, in which services the
regiment had several men killed and wounded. This demonstration
having produced the desired effect, the strong fortress of _Namur_
was exposed to an attack from the main army, and it was accordingly
invested, and the siege commenced.

The attack on Kenoque was then desisted in; the FOURTEENTH Regiment
was one of the corps withdrawn from West Flanders, and joined the
covering army, under the Prince of Vaudemont, at Wouterghem.

From Wouterghem, the regiment marched towards Namur, to take part
in the siege of that important fortress, which was deemed nearly
impregnable, and was defended by a numerous garrison, under the
celebrated Marshal Boufflers. On arriving before Namur the regiment
pitched its tents at Templeux, from whence it advanced and took its
turn of duty in the trenches.

On the 8th of July, the regiment was on duty before Namur, and
it was ordered to support the attacks to be made that evening on
the covered-way near the hill of _Bouge_: the storming party was
commanded by Major-General Ramsay. About seven o'clock in the
evening, the signal for the attack was given, and the storming
party rushed forward with the most distinguished heroism. The
FOURTEENTH moved forward to support the attack, and mingling with
the combatants evinced signal intrepidity. The soldiers rushed up
to the enemy's palisades, and placing the muzzles of their muskets
between the staves, fired a volley, which put the French into some
confusion. The palisades were afterwards broken;--the supporting
corps joined in the assault,--the second covered-way was carried,
and the French overpowered, driven from their works, pursued among
the batteries on the brow of the hill, and many of them were killed
in the stone pits in which they took refuge. This post having been
thus captured, the FOURTEENTH Regiment retired, and being relieved
from duty in the trenches, it returned to its camp at Templeux,
a league and a half from Namur. Its loss was severe:--Lieutenant
Ravisson was killed; Captain Carew and Ensign Perott died of their
wounds; Captains Pope, Jackson, and Forbes, and Ensign Cormach,
were wounded, but afterwards recovered.

The regiment quitted its post at Templeux, took its station in the
lines of circumvallation, and mounted guard in the trenches, on
the 10th of July; it was again on duty in the trenches on the 16th
of July, when it had Captain Forbes and several private soldiers
killed.

A detachment of the grenadiers of the regiment was engaged, on the
17th of July, in an attack upon the counterscarp; the assault was
made about five o'clock in the evening; the French disputed the
post with great bravery, defending the glacis for some time; but
they could not withstand the prowess of the British grenadiers,
who effected a lodgment, and obliged the enemy to abandon the
counterscarp. Lieutenant Williams of the grenadier company of
the regiment was killed, and Captain Devaux was wounded with the
working party.

The regiment was again on duty in the trenches on the 19th and 24th
of July. On the following day the town surrendered, the garrison
retiring to the castle.

After the surrender of the town of Namur, the regiment quitted
the lines of circumvallation, and joined the covering army under
the Prince of Vaudemont, which encamped, on the 8th of August,
near the village of Waterloo, and afterwards took up a position
near _Namur_. A numerous French army commanded by Marshal Villeroy
advanced to raise the siege of the castle, but the covering army
occupied a position which was deemed too formidable to be attacked,
and the French Marshal withdrew without hazarding an engagement.

A detachment from the grenadier company of the regiment quitted
the covering army, and was engaged, on the 20th of August, in
assaulting the breaches of the Terra Nova and Coharne, under
the command of Lord Cutts. This proved a desperate service,
particularly the assault of the Terra Nova, where the British
grenadiers were engaged, and a serious loss was sustained in
consequence of the regiments ordered to support the attack not
advancing in time. The FOURTEENTH Foot had several men killed and
wounded, and Lieutenant Sewell, who commanded the detachment from
the grenadier company, was also wounded.

Preparations were made for a second assault, when Marshal Boufflers
agreed to surrender on honorable terms, which were granted. Thus
was captured this important fortress, which the French had boasted
might be restored, but could not be taken; and the achievement
reflected great credit on the confederate arms; it was the most
important event of the war.

After the surrender of the castle of _Namur_, the regiment
remained a short time in the field, and subsequently marched into
cantonments in the villages near the Bruges canal.

[Sidenote: 1696]

The French monarch not only found his career of conquest arrested,
by the efforts of the sovereign of Great Britain, but the towns he
had captured were also being re-taken, and it became a point of
great importance to him to detach England from the confederacy,
which could only be accomplished by re-placing King James on the
throne. For this purpose measures were privately concerted for
exciting a rebellion in England; the Duke of Berwick, and several
other English officers in the French service, were sent across the
Channel in disguise, and through their persuasions a number of
men were prepared to rise at a moment's notice; at the same time
a conspiracy was formed in London to assassinate King William,
and fifty men were engaged and prepared with arms to commit the
diabolical act: a French naval and land force was also held in
readiness for a descent on the English coast, and King James was at
Calais prepared to embark. At this juncture, the FOURTEENTH, and a
number of other regiments, received orders to return to England,
and they arrived at Gravesend in March, 1696. The conspiracy was,
however, discovered; a British fleet was sent to blockade the
French ports, and the designs of the King of France being thus
defeated, King William was left at liberty to prosecute the war for
the security of the civil and religious liberties of the nations
of Europe. Several of the corps which had arrived from Flanders
returned to the seat of war immediately; but the FOURTEENTH was
one of the regiments selected to remain on home service; it landed
at Gravesend on the 22nd of March, and proceeded to Canterbury and
Feversham, from whence it was removed to London in November, and
took the duty at the Tower.

[Sidenote: 1697]

In 1697, King William saw his efforts for the preservation of
national independence attended with success; the French monarch was
humbled, and the treaty of Ryswick fixed the balance of power in
Europe.

[Sidenote: 1698]

Soon after the restoration of peace, the regiment received orders
to proceed to Ireland, and it landed at Belfast and Cork in March,
1698; at the same time it was placed upon a peace establishment.

[Sidenote: 1701]

[Sidenote: 1702]

King James died in France in 1701, when Louis XIV. proclaimed the
Pretender King of Great Britain by the title of James III.; this
event, with the elevation of the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis
XIV., to the throne of Spain, in violation of solemn engagements,
was followed by a sanguinary war with France and Spain, during
which the continent of Europe, and the peninsula of Portugal and
Spain, became theatres for the display of British valour, but
the FOURTEENTH Regiment was selected to remain in Ireland. The
proclamation of the Pretender, and the death of King William III.,
in March, 1702, revived the hopes of the partisans of the Stuart
family, who were conspiring to elevate the Pretender to the throne,
and Queen Anne deemed it expedient to detain a few trusty corps, of
approved devotion to the Protestant interest, in Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1703]

Although the honorable distinction of being selected to remain in
Ireland, prevented the regiment acquiring laurels in the field,
yet it sent several drafts of men on foreign service, who had
opportunities of distinguishing themselves. In the autumn of 1703
it furnished a draft of fifty men to complete Lord Montjoy's,
and another draft of the same strength for Colonel Brudenel's
regiments, (afterwards disbanded,) on their embarkation to
accompany the Archduke Charles of Austria to Portugal. The regiment
was in garrison at Dublin from the 7th of August to the 31st of
December, 1703.

[Sidenote: 1705]

In the autumn of 1704, and the spring of 1705, additional
detachments were sent to Portugal, to serve under General the
Earl of Galway; they were conducted thither by Captain Laffit,
Ensigns Schackford and Blount, and three serjeants, whose expenses,
amounting to 70_l._ 19_s._ 4½_d._, were directed to be paid by
a warrant dated the 5th of July, 1705. In August of the same
year the regiment furnished a captain, lieutenant, ensign, two
serjeants, and fifty rank and file towards completing the regiments
of Charlemont, George, and Caulfield, (afterwards disbanded,) on
their embarkation with the expedition under General the Earl of
Peterborough, who captured Barcelona, and had astonishing success
in Catalonia and Valentia.

[Sidenote: 1706]

The regiment was quartered at Dublin from March to November, 1706,
and the private soldiers received a penny a day in addition to
their pay, granted by King William III. in 1699, to all regiments
employed on duty at Dublin. The FOURTEENTH had, however performed
the duty of two regiments for some time, and the allowance was
extended to all detachments, in consideration of the good conduct
of the corps.

[Sidenote: 1707]

[Sidenote: 1712]

The FOURTEENTH Regiment remained in Ireland during the whole of
the war, continuing to send detachments abroad from time to time,
particularly to Portugal and Spain, and its excellent conduct on
home service occasioned it to be held in high estimation by the
Government.

[Sidenote: 1713]

On the 14th of June, 1713, Lieutenant-General Tidcomb died at Bath;
and Queen Anne conferred the colonelcy of the regiment on Colonel
Jasper Clayton, from the half-pay of a newly-raised corps which was
disbanded a short time previously.

[Sidenote: 1714]

[Sidenote: 1715]

The decease of Queen Anne, and the accession of King George I.,
in 1714, was followed by renewed efforts on the part of the
partisans of the Pretender to procure his elevation to the throne;
these exertions began to assume an alarming appearance in the
summer of 1715, when the well-known attachment of the FOURTEENTH
Regiment to the Protestant succession, occasioned it to be recalled
from Ireland, and ordered to Scotland, where the Jacobites were
numerous, and it landed at Saltcoats in Ayrshire early in the
summer.

In the autumn the Earl of Mar assembled his vassals, erected the
standard of the Pretender in the Highlands, and summoned the
clans to take arms. The royal forces in Scotland were encamped at
Stirling under Major-General Wightman; the FOURTEENTH Regiment
joined the camp in October, and the Duke of Argyle assumed the
command; but his Grace had not four thousand men to confront ten
thousand under the Earl of Mar.

When the rebel army advanced towards the Firth, the King's troops
quitted the camp at Stirling and proceeded towards _Dumblain_;
and on the morning of the 13th of November the hostile forces
confronted each other on Sheriffmuir: the FOURTEENTH foot were
posted in the left wing of the royal army. The rebels advanced to
commence the engagement, and at that moment it was deemed necessary
to make some alteration in the position of the royal forces; as
the left wing was taking up the new alignment, it was attacked
by a body of the clans of very superior numbers, and put into
some confusion: at the same time the right wing of the royal army
overpowered the left wing of the rebel host, and drove it from
the field; each commander having one wing triumphant and one wing
defeated. The FOURTEENTH, and several other corps on the left,
resisted the charge of the clans a short time, but being attacked
in the act of forming, and engaged by very superior numbers,
they fell back a short distance; they thus became separated from
the remainder of the army, and retiring beyond Dumblain, took
possession of the passes to prevent the clans penetrating towards
Stirling. Both armies retained their position during the day,
and the rebels, being defeated in their design of penetrating
southward, afterwards retired; when the King's troops returned to
their camp at Stirling.

The FOURTEENTH Foot had one lieutenant and six rank and file
killed; fourteen rank and file wounded; Captain Barlow, Lieutenant
Griffin, and several private soldiers were made prisoners.

The Pretender arrived in Scotland soon afterwards, and his presence
appeared to give new life to his adherents.

[Sidenote: 1716]

Additional forces joined the army under the Duke of Argyle: the
FOURTEENTH was formed in brigade with the Third, Twenty-first,
and Thirty-sixth regiments, under Brigadier-General Morrison; and
in January, 1716, the royal troops advanced, marching through
snow, over ice, and exposed to severe weather, when the Pretender
retreated, and losing all hope of success he escaped, with the
leaders of the rebellion, to France: the Highlanders, finding
themselves deserted by their commanders, dispersed. After pursuing
the insurgents some distance, the FOURTEENTH was quartered a short
time at Dunkeld.

[Sidenote: 1717]

[Sidenote: 1718]

The rebellion being suppressed, the regiment was stationed in
garrison at Fort William, which was built in the reign of King
William III., in a plain, on a navigable arm of the sea called
Loch Eil, near the influx of the Lochy and Nevis, in the shire of
Inverness. At this place the regiment was stationed during the year
1717, and in 1718 it marched from thence to Perth, and afterwards
to Inverness, where it remained until June of the following year.

[Sidenote: 1719]

In the mean time Scotland had not enjoyed a state of tranquillity;
but the minds of the people had been constantly agitated by the
projects of the friends of the Pretender. When the Earl of Mar's
rebellion was suppressed, the King of Sweden made preparations
for a descent in favour of the Pretender; and when that project
failed, the King of Spain fitted out an armament to place the
Pretender on the throne. The Spanish fleet was dispersed by a
storm; but two ships arrived on the coast of Scotland, in April,
1719, and four hundred Spaniards, with about a hundred Scots and
English gentlemen, landed at Kintail, on the main within Skye, and
encamped opposite the castle of Donan, where they were joined by
about fifteen hundred men of the clans. To oppose this force the
FOURTEENTH left Inverness on the 5th of June, and being united
with three troops of the Scots Greys, the Eleventh and Fifteenth
Regiments, under Major-General Wightman, arrived about four o'clock
on the afternoon of the 10th of June at _Glenshiel_, when the
Spaniards and Highlanders retreated and formed for battle on the
romantic mountain scenery of the pass of Straichell. The King's
troops advanced, and at five o'clock the signal for battle was
given, when the infantry climbed the rocky crags and opened a sharp
fire of musketry, which was re-echoed in the hollows beneath;
at the same time the Greys charged along the road to force the
pass. The enemy returned the fire, but soon gave way, and were
chased from rock to rock for some time; on gaining the top of
the hill they made a momentary stand, but the King's infantry
sent forward a shower of bullets and advanced at a running pace
to charge with bayonets, when the Spaniards and Highlanders fled
in every direction. The soldiers passed the night in the hills;
the Spaniards surrendered on the following day; the Highlanders
dispersed; and the Marquis of Tullibardine, the Earl of Seaforth,
and other rebel leaders, fled to the continent.

[Sidenote: 1721]

After this service the regiment marched to the castle of Bran, near
Kainloch-Benchven, Inverness-shire; and in 1721 it proceeded to
Edinburgh.

[Sidenote: 1722]

The regiment quitted Scotland in May, 1722, and marched to
Hungerford: in the summer it was encamped, with several other
corps, on Salisbury-plain, where it was reviewed by King George I.
on the 30th of August, and afterwards returned to Hungerford.

[Sidenote: 1723]

Early in 1723 the regiment marched to Reading and Windsor; it was
subsequently encamped in Hyde-park, and in the autumn marched to
Bristol.

[Sidenote: 1725]

[Sidenote: 1726]

[Sidenote: 1727]

In May, 1725, the regiment commenced its march for Berwick; in
July, 1726, it was removed to Lancashire; and in January, 1727, it
marched to Canterbury, from whence four companies were detached to
Dover, Ashford, Sandwich, and Feversham.

At this period the Spaniards had commenced the siege of
_Gibraltar_, which fortress had been captured by a British and
Dutch armament in 1704, and had been ceded to Great Britain at the
treaty of Utrecht, in 1713. The colonel of the FOURTEENTH, Jasper
Clayton, was Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar; he proceeded thither
in January, 1727, and took the command of the garrison, which
opened its fire on the Spanish troops on the 21st of February; and
in March the regiment embarked to take part in the defence of that
important fortress, where it arrived on the 21st of April, together
with a battalion of Foot Guards, and the Governor, General the Earl
of Portmore. The regiment landed immediately, and it had the honor
to take an active share in the successful defence of this valuable
entrepôt to the Mediterranean. The Spaniards continued the siege
until many men had perished in the attempt, and the tremendous fire
of their artillery had produced little effect besides the bursting
and damaging of their own cannon. In the early part of June the
fire slackened, and on the 18th of that month hostilities ceased.

[Sidenote: 1729]

The regiment was afterwards selected to form part of the garrison
of Gibraltar, where it was stationed during the following fifteen
years. Previously to quitting England, two companies were added to
its establishment; these companies remained on home service; they
were stationed in the south of England until 1729, when they were
disbanded.

[Sidenote: 1739]

[Sidenote: 1740]

[Sidenote: 1742]

War between Great Britain and Spain was resumed in 1739; and the
claims of the Elector of Bavaria on the kingdoms of Bohemia and
Hungary, which were attempted to be enforced after the death of
the Emperor, Charles VI., in 1740, involved Great Britain in
hostilities with France and Bavaria. King George II. resolved
to support the House of Austria; the garrison of Gibraltar was
reinforced, and the FOURTEENTH Regiment, having been relieved from
duty at that fortress, arrived at Portsmouth in September, 1742.
After reposing a few days in barracks at Portsmouth, the regiment
marched into quarters in Yorkshire, the head-quarters being at York.

[Sidenote: 1743]

In the summer of this year, His Majesty sent an army to Flanders
to support the House of Austria, and on the 16th of June, 1743,
the colonel of the FOURTEENTH Foot, Lieutenant-General JASPER
CLAYTON, who was employed on the staff of the British army in
Flanders, was killed at the battle of Dettingen; he was an officer
of distinguished merit; his fall was regretted by the King and the
whole army, and his remains were interred, with great solemnity,
in the Chapel of Prince George of Hesse. The King conferred
the command of the regiment on Colonel JOSEPH PRICE, from the
Fifty-seventh, now Forty-sixth Foot, by commission dated the 22nd
of June, 1743.

[Sidenote: 1744]

From Yorkshire the regiment marched into Northumberland, and
was stationed at Berwick; in 1744, it marched to Dunstable and
afterwards to Colchester.

[Sidenote: 1745]

Immediately on the receipt of the news of the loss of the battle of
Fontenoy, on the 30th of April, 1745, the regiment received orders
to proceed to Flanders, to join the allied army commanded by His
Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland; it embarked at Tilbury, on
the 15th of May, landed in West Flanders, and joined the camp on
the plain of Lessines, before the end of the month. The regiment
took part in several operations; it was encamped at Grammont, and
afterwards on the Brussels' canal, in order to cover Dutch Brabant;
but the French had so great a superiority of numbers, that it was
found impossible to prevent their capturing several fortified towns.

In the mean time, Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, had
arrived in Scotland, and being guided by desperate and designing
men, and joined by a number of the clans, he resolved on the
romantic enterprise of attempting to dethrone a beloved monarch,
to overturn the constitution of a brave and free people, and
to establish the authority of a dynasty which had been removed
for arbitrary attacks on the established religion and laws. The
FOURTEENTH was one of the regiments ordered home on this occasion;
it arrived in the north of England, and formed part of the army
assembled by Field-Marshal Wade, at Newcastle, to prevent the
rebels penetrating into South Britain; and, in the second week of
November, it was detached to Berwick, where it arrived in time to
prevent the rebels capturing that town. The regiment afterwards
marched to Scotland, and when the clans made a precipitate retreat
from Derby, back to Scotland, it took up its quarters in the city
of Edinburgh.

[Sidenote: 1746]

The young Pretender was joined by some new levies, and he procured
a supply of artillery and ammunition, which enabled him to commence
the siege of Stirling Castle: and Lieutenant-General Hawley, who
commanded the King's troops at Edinburgh, resolved to attempt to
raise the siege. For this purpose, the FOURTEENTH, and several
other corps, advanced from Edinburgh on the 13th of January, 1746,
under Major-General Huske, and drove a body of the rebels out
of Linlithgow; on the following day another division marched to
Borrowstounness; and on the 16th of January, the army encamped near
_Falkirk_.

About mid-day on the 17th of January, the rebel army was seen
moving towards some high ground on Falkirk-moor, and the King's
troops quitted their camp-ground to engage the clans. Passing
some rugged grounds, the soldiers diverged on the moor, and
formed two lines; the Fourth and FOURTEENTH Regiments constituted
Brigadier-General Cholmondeley's brigade, and were posted in the
first line. As the King's troops advanced to battle a tremendous
hurricane, with a heavy shower of rain, beat violently in their
faces, and nearly blinded them; at the same time it beat on the
backs of the clans, and caused them little annoyance; the soldiers
could not see to take aim, very few muskets would give fire,
and, under these circumstances, some confusion took place, and
several regiments quitted the field; but the Fourth and FOURTEENTH
Regiments under Brigadier-General Cholmondeley made a determined
stand, and they withstood the fury of the charging Highland host
with astonishing firmness, evincing the most heroic valour under
circumstances of peculiar danger and difficulty. They were joined
by the second battalion of the Royals, the Third and Forty-eighth
Regiments; Major-General Huske assumed the command; and these five
corps repulsed one wing of the rebel army, and maintained their
post, on the field of battle, until night, when no enemy could be
seen, and the soldiers being wet, and the night cold and stormy,
they retired.

The King's troops retreated to Edinburgh, where His Royal Highness
the Duke of Cumberland arrived, and assumed the command, and on the
31st of January the army again advanced, when the rebels raised the
siege of Stirling Castle, and made a precipitate retreat towards
Inverness. The royal army pursued the rebels as far as Perth, where
it halted in consequence of severe weather; the march was resumed
on the 20th of February; but heavy rains occasioned the army to
make another halt at Aberdeen. The troops were again in motion in
the early part of April, and on the 16th of that month, as they
advanced in three columns towards Inverness, the rebel army was
discovered in order of battle on _Culloden_-moor, when the royal
forces formed three lines, the FOURTEENTH Foot taking post in
the centre of the first line, under Lieut.-General the Earl of
Albemarle. After a sharp cannonade, several clans rushed forward,
with loud shouts, to attack the King's troops sword in hand; but
they were assailed by a destructive fire of musketry, received on
the point of the bayonet, and driven back with severe loss. The
royal cavalry galloped forward, completed the rout and discomfiture
of the clans, and pursued them with great slaughter several miles.
This victory transformed the young Pretender from an imaginary
monarch to an humble fugitive, and after wandering for some time in
disguise in the isles, and among the mountains, he escaped to the
continent.

The loss of the regiment at the battle of _Culloden_ was limited to
Captain Grosette, and one private soldier killed; Captain Simpson
and nine rank and file wounded[2].

After returning from the pursuit of the rebels, the troops encamped
near Inverness, from whence they advanced in May, and pitched
their tents in a valley, surrounded by lofty mountains, near
Fort Augustus. The FOURTEENTH Regiment was employed in guarding
prisoners taken after the battle, and was afterwards stationed at
Stirling, from whence it was removed to Glasgow.

[Sidenote: 1747]

In June, 1747 the regiment marched from Glasgow to Perth, and in
September to Inverness.

The colonel of the regiment, Brigadier-General Price, commanded
a brigade in the Netherlands, and highly distinguished himself
at the battle of Val, on the 2nd of July, 1747; he died at Breda
in November of the same year; when King George II. conferred the
colonelcy on the Honourable William Herbert, fifth son of Thomas,
eighth Earl of Pembroke, from captain and lieutenant-colonel in the
Second Foot Guards.

[Sidenote: 1749]

[Sidenote: 1750]

The regiment remained in Scotland; in 1749 it was stationed at
Fort William; and in 1750 at Glasgow, from whence it marched to
Carlisle and Newcastle.

[Sidenote: 1751]

In 1751 a royal warrant was issued regulating the clothing,
colours, and standards of the several regiments of the army.
In this warrant the first, or King's colour, of the FOURTEENTH
Regiment, is directed to be the great union: the second, or
regimental colour, to be of _buff_ silk, with the union in the
upper canton; in the centre of the colours XIV. in gold Roman
characters, within a wreath of roses and thistles on the same stalk.

The uniform of the regiment at this period, was black
three-cornered cocked hats, bound with white lace; scarlet coats
faced with yellow, yellow cuffs and white lace; scarlet waistcoats
and breeches; white gaiters, and white cravats; buff belts, and
buff pouches. The drummers wore buff coats faced with scarlet. The
grenadiers wore cloth caps with the king's cipher and crown in
front; the "_white horse_," with the motto "_Nec aspera terrent_,"
on the flap; and the number of the regiment behind.

In August of this year orders were issued for the regiment to march
to the south of England, and to furnish detachments on the coast of
Sussex, to assist the officers of the revenue in the prevention of
smuggling.

[Sidenote: 1752]

The regiment called in its detachments in the beginning of April,
1752, and marching to Portsmouth, embarked for Gibraltar, where it
was stationed during the following seven years.

[Sidenote: 1753]

Colonel the Honorable William Herbert was removed to the Second
Dragoon Guards in 1753, and was succeeded in the colonelcy
of the FOURTEENTH Regiment by Colonel Edward Braddock, from
lieutenant-colonel in the Second Foot Guards.

[Sidenote: 1755]

In 1755, some disputes occurred between England and France,
respecting the extent of the British dominions in America, and
Major-General Braddock was mortally wounded at Fort du Quesne: he
was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Fowke, governor of Gibraltar,
from the Second Foot, by commission dated the 12th of November,
1755.

[Sidenote: 1756]

War commenced between Great Britain and France in 1756, when a
French armament attacked the island of Minorca, which was captured
in 1708, and ceded to the British crown at the peace of Utrecht in
1713. Lieutenant-General Fowke received orders to send a detachment
from Gibraltar, to reinforce the garrison of Port Mahon; but he
called a council of war, which passed a resolution against sending
the detachment. He was sentenced to be suspended for nine months,
for disobeying the order, and King George II. dismissed him from
the service. His Majesty afterwards conferred the colonelcy
of the FOURTEENTH Regiment on Colonel Charles Jefferies, from
colonel-commandant of the third battalion of the Sixtieth Regiment,
who had distinguished himself in the defence of Port Mahon.

[Sidenote: 1759]

[Sidenote: 1760]

[Sidenote: 1761]

In December, 1759, the regiment was relieved from garrison duty at
Gibraltar, and embarking for England, arrived, in January, 1760, at
Plymouth, from whence it marched to Canterbury, and in the summer
it was encamped, with the Nineteenth and Twenty-first Regiments,
on Barham Downs under Lieutenant-General Campbell. In October the
FOURTEENTH struck their tents, and marched to Dover Castle, where
they remained during the following year.

[Sidenote: 1762]

[Sidenote: 1763]

The regiment marched to Maidstone, and furnished a guard over
French prisoners of war at Sissinghurst in October, 1762; in
December it proceeded to Exeter; from whence it was removed in
March, 1763, to Plymouth.

[Sidenote: 1764]

Leaving Plymouth in March, 1764, the regiment proceeded to the
vicinity of London, and was reviewed on Wimbledon Common: on the
7th of May it was reviewed in Hyde Park by King George III., who
was pleased to express his high approbation of its appearance and
discipline; after the review it marched to Chatham and Dover.

[Sidenote: 1765]

Major-General Jefferies died in May, 1765, and the King conferred
the colonelcy of the regiment on Major-General the Honorable
William Keppel, fourth son of William Anne, second Earl of
Albemarle, from the Fifty-sixth Foot.

At this period, three companies of the regiment were employed on
duty at Windsor and Hampton Court, and their good conduct attracted
the attention of the King, George III., who was always ready to
confer marks of his royal approbation on corps and individuals.
His Majesty made some alterations in the clothing, and directed
the "_white horse_," with the motto "_Nec aspera terrent_," to be
placed on the black bear-skin caps to be worn by the grenadiers,
and on the white caps to be worn by the drummers[3].

[Sidenote: 1766]

Towards the end of May, 1766, the regiment marched into village
quarters near Hounslow Heath, where it was reviewed on the 4th of
June by the King, who was graciously pleased to express his royal
approbation of its appearance and movements in the field. After
the review the regiment marched to Salisbury and adjacents.

[Sidenote: 1771]

In June the regiment embarked at Portsmouth for North America,
and was stationed in Nova Scotia and Canada until 1771, when it
embarked from Halifax for the West Indies, to take part in reducing
to submission to the British government, the refractory Caribbees
in _St. Vincent's_.

[Sidenote: 1772]

[Sidenote: 1773]

The island of St. Vincent's was captured from the French in 1762,
and was ceded to Great Britain at the peace in 1763; it was found
to contain two tribes of natives called the _red_ and _black_
Caribs, the former being the Aborigines, and the latter having
sprung from a cargo of African slaves, who escaped from a vessel
which was wrecked on the island. The Caribbees were devoted
to the French interest; they were dangerous and troublesome
neighbours to the English planters, and it was found necessary to
restrain their conduct, and enforce obedience to a few salutary
regulations. They were, however, of a determined spirit, possessed
many thickly-wooded fastnesses, and so resolutely resisted all
attempts to restrain their roving propensities and mode of life,
that it was found necessary to augment the military force on the
island. The FOURTEENTH Foot were employed against the refractory
Caribbees in 1772 and 1773; numerous skirmishes occurred among the
thickly-wooded parts of the country, and several soldiers were
killed and wounded, in the bush fighting, which took place daily
for some time. At length the Caribbees were reduced to submission:
and the regiment returned to North America, leaving a number of
sick men and others in the West Indies.

[Sidenote: 1774]

[Sidenote: 1775]

The regiment was stationed at Virginia in North America, when the
misunderstanding between Great Britain and these prosperous and
wealthy colonies, produced open hostilities. The spirit which the
colonists evinced in resisting the acts of the British parliament,
for raising a revenue in their country, assumed a serious aspect
in the years 1773 and 1774, and in 1775 hostilities commenced in
the state of Massachusetts. The FOURTEENTH Regiment remained in the
state of Virginia for some time afterwards; it was, consequently,
not at Bunker's Hill; but it lost two promising officers at that
battle, on the 17th of June, 1775, who were attending Major-General
Howe during the engagement: viz., Lieutenant and Adjutant Bruce,
who was killed, and Ensign Hesketh mortally wounded.

On the 18th of October, 1775, the colonelcy of the regiment
was conferred on Major-General Robert Cunninghame, from the
Fifty-eighth Foot, in succession to Lieutenant-General the
Honorable William Keppel, removed to the Twelfth Dragoons.

The regiment was stationed at Norfolk, in Virginia, from whence a
detachment of one hundred and twenty men, under Captain Fordyce,
advanced at midnight on the 8th of December, against the American
entrenchments at _Great Bridge_. At day-break the detachment
crossed the bridge, and the grenadiers moved forward with great
gallantry to storm the works, Lieutenant Batut being at the head
of the leading section; but as they approached the entrenchments,
a body of Americans, of very superior numbers, assailed them with
a destructive fire of musketry: Captain Fordyce and twelve men
were killed within a few yards of the breast-work; Lieutenant
Batut and sixteen soldiers were wounded and taken prisoners, and
the remainder of the detachment retreated across the bridge to a
British fort, garrisoned by a detachment under Captain Leslie. The
Americans buried Captain Fordyce with military honors.

[Sidenote: 1776]

The American troops afterwards increased in numbers so fast, that
the royal forces were withdrawn from Virginia, and the FOURTEENTH
Foot proceeded to the army under General Sir William Howe, at New
York, where they were joined by a detachment which had been left at
Nova Scotia on the embarkation of the regiment for the West Indies.
After arriving at New York, part of the regiment was stationed
on Staten Island, and the remainder was employed in the general
operations of the army.

[Sidenote: 1777]

The regiment had sustained a serious loss at St. Vincent's, and
being weak in numbers, it was directed to draft the private
soldiers fit for duty to other corps, and return to England, where
it arrived in the summer of 1777, and active measures were adopted
to recruit its ranks.

[Sidenote: 1778]

[Sidenote: 1779]

During the year 1778 the regiment was stationed in the south
of England; and in the summer of 1779 it pitched its tents on
Coxheath, where a camp was formed of the Sixth, FOURTEENTH,
Fiftieth, Sixty-fifth, and Sixty-ninth Regiments, with sixteen
battalions of militia, under Lieutenant-General Pierson.

[Sidenote: 1780]

[Sidenote: 1781]

The regiment marched to Gosport in 1780, and pitched its tents at
Stokes-bay, furnishing working parties at Fort Monkton, and a guard
over the French, Spanish, and American prisoners of war, at Forton
prison. In July the regiment embarked as marines on board the
Channel fleet commanded by Admiral Darby, who, in 1781, relieved
Gibraltar, which fortress was besieged by a combined French and
Spanish force.

[Sidenote: 1782]

Having completed its recruiting, and attained a state of
efficiency, the regiment embarked from Portsmouth, in January,
1782, for Jamaica; it was on board of transports in the harbour of
St. Lucia, during Admiral Rodney's engagement with the French fleet
under Count de Grasse, on the 12th of April, and afterwards mounted
guard over the Count, when a prisoner on that island.

The regiment proceeded to Jamaica, and was formed to receive Prince
William Henry, (afterwards King William IV.,) then a midshipman,
on his landing at Spanish Town, and mounted guard at his quarters
during his stay on the island.

Soon after its arrival at Jamaica, the regiment received orders,
dated the 31st of August, 1782, to assume the title of the
"FOURTEENTH, OR BEDFORDSHIRE REGIMENT OF FOOT," and to cultivate a
connection with that county, so as to create a mutual attachment
between the inhabitants of Bedfordshire and the regiment, which
might, at all times, be useful towards recruiting the corps.

[Sidenote: 1787]

On the 4th of April, 1787, Lieutenant-General Robert Cunninghame
was removed to the Fifth Royal Irish Dragoons, and was succeeded in
the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Foot, by Lieutenant-General John
Douglas, who had commanded the Twenty-first Light Dragoons, which
corps was disbanded in 1783.

[Sidenote: 1788]

The FOURTEENTH Regiment attended the funeral of the Honorable
Captain Chetwynd, of His Majesty's ship "Europa," in November,
1788, at which the Governor of Jamaica,--His Royal Highness Prince
William Henry (then a captain of the Royal Navy),--the officers of
the squadron, and a number of gentlemen in carriages, were present.
The regiment marched at the head of the procession in funeral
order, the band playing the Dead March; and the remains of this
distinguished officer were interred in the chancel of the church at
Spanish Town.

[Sidenote: 1789]

Lieutenant-General Douglas having been removed to the Fifth Dragoon
Guards, His Majesty conferred the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Foot
on Colonel George Earl Waldegrave, by commission, dated the 27th
of August, 1789. Earl Waldegrave died about six weeks after his
appointment, and was succeeded by Colonel George Hotham, from
captain and lieutenant-colonel of the First Foot Guards.

[Sidenote: 1792]

Having been relieved from duty at Jamaica, the regiment embarked on
board of His Majesty's ship Dover, of forty-four guns, on the 9th
of April, 1791, and landed at Portsmouth on the 10th of June. In
the autumn it marched to Chatham, and afterwards to Canterbury; and
on Friday, the 21st of November, it received their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of York, at Dover, on their arrival from the
Continent; the Duke of York having married, a few weeks previously,
Frederica Charlotte Ulrica, Princess Royal of Prussia.

[Sidenote: 1793]

Early in 1792 the regiment returned to Chatham, and was brigaded
with the Third Foot (the Buffs) under the command of Colonel Fox;
in June the two regiments encamped on Bagshot-heath, with several
other corps, under the command of the Duke of Richmond: at this
camp the regiment remained three weeks; it was reviewed several
times by His Majesty, and afterwards returned to Chatham, where it
remained several months.

In the meantime a revolution had taken place in France, where a
republican party had seized the reins of government, beheaded their
sovereign, and involved the country in anarchy and bloodshed. Not
content with carrying the horrors of democracy into every part of
France, the republicans endeavoured to propagate their doctrines
in all countries, and to overturn the constitution of every
monarchy in Europe. Under these circumstances, the British people
became involved in war for the defence of the fixed rights of
their sovereign, the preservation of their own civil and religious
liberties, and of their honor as a nation.

The FOURTEENTH Regiment was one of the first corps completed to a
war establishment, under the zealous and judicious arrangements of
its excellent commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel WELBORE ELLIS
DOYLE, who assumed the command on the arrival of the regiment from
Jamaica in 1791; it was also one of the corps selected for foreign
service at the commencement of the war; and embarking at Dover, on
the 19th March, 1793, for Holland, to aid the Dutch in repelling
an attack of the French, it landed at Helvoetsluys, in the island
of Voorn, on the 25th of March, being the first regiment of the
line which arrived at the scene of war. The success of the allied
arms had removed the theatre of war from Holland to the confines
of French Flanders; and the FOURTEENTH Regiment, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Doyle, proceeded to Briel, where it embarked
for Antwerp, whence it marched to Ghent, and was removed in canal
boats to Bruges, where it halted a few days. From Bruges it marched
to Tournay, where it arrived towards the end of April; and the
flank companies, with those of the Thirty-seventh and Fifty-third
Regiments, were placed under the orders of Major Mathews, of the
Fifty-third, and detached to Marquain, to watch the motions of the
enemy, in which service they were employed until the 20th of May.

The Duke of York assumed the command of the British and Hanoverian
troops in Flanders, and co-operated with the Austrians under
the Prince of Saxe-Cobourg. On the 23rd of May the FOURTEENTH
Regiment was engaged in the attack of the enemy's fortified
camp at _Famars_, and evinced great gallantry. Being composed
principally of young soldiers, they rushed up the heights with
great impetuosity to attack the enemy, but did not preserve
sufficient order; Lieut.-Colonel Doyle galloped to the front,
halted, and reformed the ranks, then bid the band play the tune
"_ça ira_," and using a few encouraging expressions to the men, led
them to the attack, when they rushed in compact order upon their
opponents, and overpowered all opposition[4]. The French retreated
across the Scheldt, and the allied army invested the fortress of
Valenciennes. Lieutenant Charles W. Doyle, who performed the duty
of brigade-major, was thanked for his conduct.

The loss of the regiment was limited to two serjeants and seven
rank and file wounded; the Duke of York expressed his approbation
of its conduct in orders.

The FOURTEENTH Regiment was employed at the siege of
_Valenciennes_, under the Duke of York, and on the 25th of July,
it furnished a detachment to take part in storming the horn-work.
Lieut.-Colonel Doyle being appointed to the command of one of
the attacking columns, obtained permission to place at the head
of his party, one hundred volunteers of the FOURTEENTH Regiment,
and having assembled the corps, he said, "Soldiers, one hundred
volunteers from among you are to lead the column that I am to
command _upon a service of the greatest danger_; I have thought
it right to state this before I call upon you; such of you as
volunteer this dangerous enterprise, recover arms:" when every
man brought his musket to the "_recover_." The colonel was much
affected by this display of devotion, and said, "Soldiers, I thank
you from my heart; where all are equally desirous of facing the
greatest danger, I cannot look, or wish, for volunteers. Officers,
call out the first ten men for duty in each company."

On the 26th of July the following general order was issued.--

"His Royal Highness the Commander-in-chief returns his thanks to
Major-General Abercrombie, Colonel Leigh, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Doyle, for the gallantry they showed on the attack last night."

Haying been constantly exposed to the cannon of the town for seven
weeks, the men had acquired great steadiness under fire, the attack
was made with signal intrepidity and resolution, and the out-works
were carried in gallant style.

The regiment had one serjeant and three rank and file killed; one
officer, one serjeant, and fourteen rank and file wounded; the
flank companies also lost seven men.

Three days afterwards the garrison capitulated, and this important
fortress was delivered up to the Duke of York.

After the surrender of Valenciennes the British troops marched
towards Cambray, and they subsequently separated from the
Austrians, taking with them a few Imperial regiments, for the
purpose of undertaking the siege of Dunkirk. On arriving at Menin,
it was ascertained that the French had driven the Dutch from
_Lincelles_; that post was recaptured by the British Foot Guards
under Major-General Lake, on the 18th of August. The FOURTEENTH
Regiment was one of the corps ordered to support the Foot Guards,
and was left in possession of the village, after its capture, until
that post was restored to the Dutch.

The army resumed its march towards _Dunkirk_ on the following
day, and on the 24th of August, the FOURTEENTH Foot took part in
driving the French out-posts, between the canal of Furnes and the
sea, into the town, on which occasion the soldiers had to force
their way through strong double hedges, and across deep ditches
full of water. A deep ditch, surrounding the garden of a chateau,
obstructed the progress of the grenadier company of the FOURTEENTH,
when Lieutenant THOMAS GREEN CLAPHAM leaped into the ditch, where
he stood up to his breast in water, that the grenadiers might pass
swiftly over it, by stepping upon his shoulders, and pursue the
French, which they did with great alacrity. The light infantry
company also displayed distinguished ardour, and captured three
pieces of artillery. Finally the French were driven into the town,
and the siege was commenced. The loss of the regiment was limited
to a few private soldiers killed and wounded.

On the 6th of September, the French made a sortie from Dunkirk,
in great strength, directing their attack principally against the
right of the besieging army, when the FOURTEENTH Foot, commanded
by Major Alexander Ross, (Lieutenant-Colonel Doyle being ill) was
ordered forward to support that part of the position. As they
passed the flank of the regiment of Esterhazy, the Germans cheered
the FOURTEENTH, and the gallant soldiers rushed into the fight with
great energy, overthrowing all opposition, and chasing the French
up the covered way. The regiment had one serjeant, one corporal,
and eight private soldiers killed; Captains Cochrane and Garnier,
Lieutenants Mackenzie, Powell, and Elrington[5], Ensigns Smith
and Williams, Volunteer McGrath, one serjeant, one corporal, and
thirty-six private soldiers, wounded.

The arrival of the heavy artillery for the siege, and the naval
force intended to co-operate with the army, in the reduction of
Dunkirk, was so long delayed, that the French had time to convey
from every part of France, by coaches, waggons, and other vehicles,
such an immense body of troops, to the vicinity of Dunkirk, that
the Duke of York had little chance of success.

Another sortie was made by the garrison on the 8th of September,
when the FOURTEENTH and Thirty-seventh Regiments advanced to
attack the French; as the two corps passed the regiment of Joseph
Colloredo, they were cheered by the Austrians, and they succeeded
in repulsing the enemy: but no chance of final success remained,
and the siege was raised, the FOURTEENTH Regiment marching by
Furnes and Ypres, to Menin.

The regiment marched, in October, to Oudenarde, where it furnished
a guard over two thousand French prisoners; it was sent forward,
several times, to take the out-post duty, and upon a movement in
advance, by the enemy, upon Menin and Wevelghem, it repulsed an
attack upon the out-post at Vervicke.

[Sidenote: 1794]

Early in 1794 the regiment left Oudenarde for Wevelghem, and
remained on outpost duty until April, when the army assembled, and
was reviewed by the Emperor of Germany, on the heights of Cateau,
where His Royal Highness William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester, was
nominated to the command of the brigade composed of the FOURTEENTH,
Thirty-seventh, and Fifty-third Regiments.

In the general attack on the enemy's positions, on the 17th
of April, the regiment formed part of the column under
Lieutenant-General Sir William Erskine, and took part in the attack
on the village of _Prêmont_, and the wood on its left.

The French having been driven from their positions, the siege of
_Landrécies_ was commenced, and the FOURTEENTH Regiment formed part
of the covering army encamped on the heights of _Cateau_; this post
was attacked on the 26th of April, by the French under General
Chapuy, who were repulsed, with great slaughter, by the British
cavalry, with the loss of many guns. On this occasion the light
company of the regiment behaved with much gallantry, and, having
advanced to a wood on the left, kept in check a considerable body
of the enemy, who meditated an attack on the batteries.

On the fall of Landrécies, the British troops moved to the vicinity
of _Tournay_, where they were attacked on the 10th of May by a
numerous body of French, who were defeated with severe loss. The
FOURTEENTH Foot lost only one man on this occasion.

At length a combined attack was made on the French positions,
with the view of forcing them to evacuate Flanders, in which the
FOURTEENTH Regiment had another opportunity of distinguishing
itself; it left Tournay on the evening of the 16th of May,--took
part in forcing the points of the French position it was destined
to attack in the direction of Lisle, on the 17th of May, and was
successful; but several Austrian columns failed to accomplish
their part in the combined movements. The British troops, having
penetrated the French position, and being left unsupported, became
exposed to the attack of the enemy's very superior numbers.
Early on the 18th of May the FOURTEENTH Regiment was environed
and attacked by an overwhelming force, but it stood its ground,
and by firing by wings and platoons with as much steadiness and
regularity as on parade, held its assailants in check. Its veteran
commanding officer, Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel BROWNE, became quite
exhausted, and sat for some time on a chair behind the colours. At
length an aide-de-camp arrived from Major-General Fox, commanding
the brigade, with orders for the FOURTEENTH to retreat; and while
performing this retrograde movement, they preserved an unbroken
formation. Surrounded by enemies, fired upon by infantry and
artillery, and menaced by cavalry, the regiment preserved its order
with astonishing firmness, forming divisions in the rear against
cavalry, and marching over ground covered with dead bodies. The
road to Lannoy, by which the regiment had advanced on the preceding
day, was found in possession of the enemy, with an abbatis and
cannon formed across it, and the first discharge killed several
grenadiers, when Major-General Fox said to Captain Clapham, "I
fear we must lay down our arms." "No, sir," replied the captain,
"the FOURTEENTH can cut through them." At this moment Corporal
GILBERT CIMITIERE[6], of the grenadiers, a French emigrant, well
acquainted with the country, stepped forward, and undertook to
conduct the brigade through the inclosures, and the troops quitted
the main road under his guidance, being followed and assailed by
the French. Lieutenant-Colonel Browne was shot through the body,
and was carried in a blanket by four grenadiers, but he suffered so
much pain that he requested them to stop, and he and they were made
prisoners. The command of the regiment devolved on Captain Perry,
of the light company, which was afterwards commanded by Lieutenant
Graves. This officer, and Lieutenant Elrington, commanded the two
rear companies of the column, and formed alternately to repulse
the French cavalry. Although every road was fortified, and the
hedges lined with troops, the brigade fought its way through the
inclosures with astonishing gallantry and resolution, and gained
the position at Templeuve, having, however, lost every piece of
artillery with the column, excepting one of the battalion guns
of the FOURTEENTH Regiment, under Lieutenant Phillott. The guide
of the column, Corporal Gilbert Cimitiere, was rewarded with a
commission.

The loss of the regiment, on this trying occasion, was one
serjeant and thirteen rank and file, killed; twenty-two rank
and file wounded: Lieutenant-Colonel Browne wounded and taken
prisoner; three serjeants, two drummers, and sixty-eight rank and
file, prisoners of war and missing, many of whom were taken in
consequence of being wounded and unable to continue the retreat.
Lieutenant-Colonel Browne died at Lisle on the following day, and
was much regretted by the officers and soldiers he had commanded
with distinguished bravery on many trying occasions. The conduct of
the brigade was commended by His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
and its gallantry is recorded in the histories of the war[7].

The regiment resumed its post in front of _Tournay_, and was in
position on the 22nd of May, when General Pichegru attacked the
allied army with an immense body of troops, first assailing the
right and afterwards the centre of the line. The FOURTEENTH being
on the left, were not engaged during the early part of the day; but
in the afternoon, the enemy carried the post of Pontechin, on the
high road from Courtray to Tournay, and the fortune of the day was
evidently flowing in favour of the French, when the brigade, formed
of the FOURTEENTH, Thirty-seventh, and Fifty-third Regiments, was
ordered to the post of honor and danger.

As the FOURTEENTH quitted their post on the left, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay, the Duke of York addressed them in the
most flattering manner, declaring his perfect reliance on their
gallantry. The three regiments moved at a running pace; though
weak in numbers, they were strong in valour and resolution, and
being conscious of their own prowess, they rushed upon their
numerous opponents fully determined to conquer or perish in the
attempt. The FOURTEENTH charged along the chaussée,--overpowered
all resistance,--carried the village,--re-formed beyond the houses
under a heavy fire[8],--raised a loud shout, and rushed forward
to storm a battery on a rising ground near a windmill, which
the French defended a short time, but afterwards abandoned it,
leaving the regiment in possession of several pieces of cannon.
This sudden burst of British valour, coming like an explosion of
thunder, amazed and confounded the French, who gave way before
the superior prowess of the British soldiers, and the current of
the battle flowed in favour of the allies. There was, however,
a protracted resistance in an orchard, where the grenadiers and
light infantry of the FOURTEENTH Foot were engaged, and several
instances of individual contempt of danger occurred. A grenadier
named RYAN refused to avail himself of the advantage of standing
behind a tree, saying "They cannot touch me;" but the next moment
he fell forward apparently dead, when Captain Clapham turned him
over, and said, "Ryan, you are only shot through the face, you will
do well yet;" "Is that all?" replied the grenadier, and jumping up
and commencing loading his firelock, he added, "Then I will have
another rap at them," and he was with difficulty prevailed upon to
go to the rear[9]. The French were eventually driven out of the
orchard; the British pressed upon their opponents, and a victory
was gained over the Republican troops, who were forced to quit the
field of battle with severe loss.

The FOURTEENTH Regiment gained great honor on this occasion;
its loss was one serjeant and four rank and file killed;
Captain Cochrane, Major of brigade, died of his wounds; one
serjeant and twenty-eight rank and file wounded; five men
missing. Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay's horse was killed, and the
Lieutenant-Colonel received four musket balls through his hat.

The following general order, dated Tournay, 23rd of May, 1794, was
published.--

"His Royal Highness the Commander-in-chief desires to express his
most particular thanks to Major-General Fox; to the FOURTEENTH
Regiment under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay; to the
Thirty-seventh Regiment commanded by Captain Lightburne; to the
Fifty-third Regiment commanded by Major Wiseman, and to the
detachment of artillery attached to them under the command of
Captain Trotter, for _that display of intrepidity and good conduct,
which reflects the greatest honor upon themselves, at the same time
that it was highly instrumental in deciding the important victory
of the 22nd instant_.

"His Royal Highness much laments the loss they have sustained; but
flatters himself they feel it, in some measure, compensated by the
credit they have gained."

In his public despatch the Duke of York, speaking of the
FOURTEENTH, Thirty-seventh, and Fifty-third Regiments,
stated,--"_Nothing could exceed the spirit and gallantry with
which they conducted themselves_, particularly in the storm of
the village of Pontechin, which they forced with the bayonet."
Historians have recorded the gallant conduct of the regiment[10];
and the royal authority was afterwards given for it to bear the
word "_Tournay_" on its colours, to commemorate its distinguished
conduct on this memorable occasion.

Notwithstanding these displays of valour, the enemy brought forward
so great a superiority of numbers that it was found necessary to
retreat, and a series of retrograde movements followed, during
which little fighting occurred, and few corps had opportunities
of distinguishing themselves. Various positions were occupied
for short periods, and after quitting the Austrian Netherlands,
attempts were made to defend Holland; but the people of that
country had imbibed the doctrines of republicanism, and they made
little effort to preserve the United Provinces from the French.
In August the FOURTEENTH regiment was encamped near Antwerp; it
was afterwards in position in the vicinity of Breda, from whence
it retired to a post beyond Bois-le-duc, and, subsequently, to
Nimeguen: it formed part of the garrison of Nimeguen for a short
period, and when that town was evacuated, the regiment proceeded
to Linden Castle; the army occupying a position beyond the Waal,
for the defence of the passage of that river. Towards the end of
December the river became frozen, and a body of the enemy crossed
on the ice; but was driven back on the 30th of that month.

[Sidenote: 1795]

The frost afterwards became more severe, and on the 4th of January,
1795, another body of French troops passed the river on the ice.
At this period, the FOURTEENTH Regiment was at Linden Castle,
from whence it advanced to take part in a combined attack on the
enemy, under Major-General David Dundas. On the 7th of January it
traversed the Rhine on the ice at Rhenen, and proceeded to Bueren
Castle. On the following morning Major-General Lord Cathcart
advanced with the light companies, thirty hulans, and a detachment
of the Twenty-seventh Regiment, to reconnoitre; and the FOURTEENTH
and Twenty-seventh regiments were afterwards brought up to attack
the enemy at _Gueldermalsen_. The FOURTEENTH formed on the ice, on
the left of the dyke, and the Twenty-seventh across the inclosure
on the right, supported by the piquets, hulans, and afterwards by
a squadron of light dragoons; and the field pieces were protected
by the grenadiers of the FOURTEENTH under Lieutenant Elrington,
who marched before the guns. Advancing in this order, the troops
drove the French before them, until they arrived at Gueldermalsen,
where a protracted resistance was made. Lieutenant Elrington, with
the grenadiers of the FOURTEENTH, charged the French artillery
at the bridge, and bayonetted the enemy at the gun, carrying the
post with great gallantry. The British battalion guns cleared the
street; the soldiers rushed forward, and were engaged from house to
house, until they had passed the village, when they were assailed
by the enemy in force. The FOURTEENTH defended the streets; the
Twenty-seventh, the church-yard; and the Twenty-eighth coming up
most opportunely on the right, threw in a flanking fire, which
compelled the enemy to retire[11]. The brigade remained in the
village during the night; it was ordered to retire on the following
morning, and the three regiments were thanked in orders for their
distinguished conduct: Lieutenant ELRINGTON, of the FOURTEENTH,
was thanked by name for his gallantry at the attack of the bridge
defended by a gun. The regiment had twelve rank and file killed;
Lieutenant-Colonel Hope (afterwards General Sir Alexander Hope,
G.C.B.), Captain Perry, one serjeant, and twenty rank and file,
wounded: Lieutenant-Colonel Hope lost the use of his right arm from
a wound in the shoulder[12]. Captain Perry died of his wounds.

After this action the regiment marched to Cullenburg, and was on
duty about a week, on the banks of the Leek, without house, tent,
or any other cover from the weather, which was particularly severe.

Numerical superiority gave the enemy so decided an advantage,
that a retreat through Holland to Germany became necessary, which
took place in the depth of winter, and was attended with severe
privation and suffering. On one occasion, after a long march, the
FOURTEENTH Foot found themselves on a dreary heath, on a dark
night, exposed to severe frost, and a snowstorm; the men's limbs
were so benumbed with cold, that the most fatal results were
apprehended; but the discovery of a large farm-house, and a barn
upon the heath, proved particularly fortunate to the soldiers.
These hardships were aggravated by the mortifying reflection,
that the regiment was retiring before an enemy, whom it had never
encountered without proving victorious. At length the regiment
arrived in Germany, where it obtained repose in comfortable
quarters; it embarked at Bremen-lee on the 9th of April, and landed
at Harwich on the 7th of May.

From Harwich the regiment marched to Hitchin and its neighbourhood;
and when passing through the several towns on its route it was
hailed with acclamations by the inhabitants; almost every officer
and soldier bore marks of bullets having passed through his
accoutrements or clothing; the colours were perforated in many
places, and were borne by Lieutenants Stuart and Graves, the two
senior subalterns,--so many casualties had occurred among the
officers. The achievements of the regiment had been made known, and
it was everywhere congratulated on its gallant exploits.

In June the regiment pitched its tents at Warley, in Essex, and
in July received orders to march to Nusthaling, near Southampton.
On passing through Dartford, the band played the republican tune
_ça ira_ (which it played when the regiment charged the position
at Famars, in 1793), when the inhabitants evinced their aversion
to democracy by throwing stones at the musicians for playing so
offensive a tune; but upon an explanation being given, the people
responded with three cheers to the honour of the brave soldiers of
the FOURTEENTH who fought at Famars.

The regiment afterwards embarked for Quiberon-bay, to support the
French emigrants under M. Sombreuil, but being detained by contrary
winds, it was directed to disembark and return to Southampton.

At this period an armament was fitting out to complete the
deliverance of the French West India islands from the power of
republicanism, and to reduce to obedience the insurgents of St.
Vincent and Grenada. The FOURTEENTH Regiment joined the expedition,
and sailed with the immense fleet of Indiamen, transports, and
merchant-vessels, under the convoy of a squadron of the royal navy
commanded by Admiral Christian, which, on quitting the British
shores, presented a magnificent spectacle calculated to impress
the mind with a just idea of British power; but the voyage had
been delayed until a very late period of the year, and the fleet
encountered so severe a storm that several ships foundered at
sea, others were wrecked on the western coast of England, and the
greater part returned to port. The fleet was re-fitted and again
put to sea, but, after encountering severe gales, it returned to
Portsmouth a second time. The "Calypso" transport, having part
of the FOURTEENTH Regiment on board, was nearly run down during
a heavy gale, by the "Charon" of forty-four guns, and lost the
main yard; but this transport continued the voyage and arrived at
Barbadoes in eleven weeks.

[Sidenote: 1796]

Several of the regiments, which returned to port, had their
destination changed; but the portion of the FOURTEENTH, which had
put back, re-embarked in February, 1796, and arrived in April at
Barbadoes, where four companies of the Twenty-eighth Foot were
attached to the regiment.

The FOURTEENTH Foot constituted part of the expedition against
_St. Lucia_, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby;
and sailed from Carlisle-bay, Barbadoes, on the 22nd of April, for
the rendezvous of the troops to be employed in the enterprise, at
Martinique, from whence the expedition sailed, on the morning of
the 26th of April, for St. Lucia, where the head quarters landed
on the 27th, near Pigeon Island, and marched to Choque Bay, to
cover the landing of the remainder of the troops. They continued
in position there a short time, till the batteries against Morne
Fortuné were completed, when they were ordered up to take part
in the ulterior operations. Prior to landing, three companies
were detached, with a force under Brigadier-General Perryn, on
the side of the Grand Cul de Sac, to facilitate the investment
of _Morne Fortuné_, and an attempt was made to drive the enemy
from the batteries on the base of the mountain, on that side; and
Major Donkin's battalion, consisting of three companies of the
FOURTEENTH and four of the Twenty-eighth, formed part of the force
employed on this service. This battalion supported the Forty-fourth
Regiment, in the column commanded by Colonel Riddell. On advancing
to the attack, the battalion was checked, at a sudden turn in a
winding road cut on the side of a steep hill, by an _abattis_
occupied by French troops, when Captain James Graves sprang up
the bank by the aid of a branch, and being assisted by Captain
Henry Cox, and Lieutenant George Morris, he helped a few soldiers
to climb up the side of the hill, who fired down upon the flank
of the troops in the _abattis_, who instantly abandoned it, and
the FOURTEENTH continued their advance. On arriving on more open
ground, the fire of the enemy's batteries was heavy; when Captain
James Graves, of the FOURTEENTH, and Captain John Frederic Brown,
of the Twenty-eighth, stormed the lower battery, called _Chapuis_,
with a few men of the two regiments. Captain Brown, Lieutenants
William F. Dalton and John Grady, with several private soldiers,
fell wounded in the advance, but the battery was captured, and was
held by Captain Graves, Lieutenant John Hutchinson, and about forty
rank and file. The soldiers being fired upon from a house, it was
forced by a few men under Lieutenant Owen, and all the defenders
bayonetted. The firing on the right indicating a retrograde
movement on the part of the British troops at that point, Serjeant
Shaw of the FOURTEENTH was detached to reconnoitre; he returned
wounded, and reported the retreat of the British, and the advance
of a fresh column of the enemy. Under these circumstances the guns
in the battery were spiked, and the soldiers retired, fighting
their way through a woody country, until they joined the column
under Brigadier-General Perryn. From the failure of part of the
attacking force the operations were not successful.

The loss of the FOURTEENTH was limited to five men killed; Captain
Cox, and one serjeant wounded. On sending a flag of truce, on the
following day, to inquire for prisoners, the answer received was,
"The republicans have made no prisoners."

An attack was afterwards made on the north side of Morne Fortuné;
a battery opened its fire against the enemy's works on the 16th of
May, and on the 24th the French desired a suspension of arms, which
was followed by the surrender of the island.

After the surrender of St. Lucia, the FOURTEENTH formed part of the
expedition against the island of _St. Vincent_, and a landing was
effected on the 8th of June: the Caribs having surrendered, the
French troops retired, in a body, to the strong fort of La Vigie.
It having been ascertained that the fort was badly provisioned,
and worse provided with water, it was clear that the garrison
could not hold out many days; and the Commander-in-Chief shortly
received information that they intended to effect an escape, by
night, by descending along the course of a deep ravine, which led
from the town through high and inaccessible rocks. A party of the
FOURTEENTH, consisting of three officers, and one hundred men, was
ordered out to occupy the pass:--they took up a position in the
bed of the river, behind some large stones, over which the men
rested their bayonets. The darkness of the night, and the position
between the woods, precluded the possibility of seeing anything,
and the rushing of the water prevented anything from being heard.
The first intimation that the party in ambuscade received of the
enemy's approach, was the fact of their actually pressing upon
their bayonets. Immediately a desultory firing took place, which
ceased only when the enemy were supposed to have retreated. When
daylight broke, a horrid spectacle of killed and wounded presented
itself. Such of the garrison as succeeded in returning to La
Vigie surrendered the next day. Captain Powell, who commanded,
Lieutenants Gibson and Beavan, and the whole party, received the
thanks of Sir Ralph Abercromby.

These captures having been accomplished, the FOURTEENTH Regiment
returned to Barbadoes, where it was stationed during the remainder
of the year.

[Sidenote: 1797]

Spain having united with France in the war against Great Britain,
orders were issued to attack the Spanish possessions in the West
Indies, and in the early part of February, 1797, the FOURTEENTH
Regiment proceeded to Cariacou, where an expedition was assembled
to attack the island of _Trinidad_. On the morning of the 15th of
February the fleet sailed on the enterprise, and as it anchored
near the shores of Trinidad, the Spaniards became conscious of
their inability to resist, and set fire to their naval force in
the harbour. The troops landed on the 17th of February, and the
Spaniards immediately surrendered, delivering up the island.

From Trinidad the regiment proceed to Martinique, where it was
stationed several weeks.

Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby assembled a small force,
in the beginning of April, for the attack of the Spanish island of
_Porto Rico_, and the FOURTEENTH were withdrawn from Martinique to
take part in the enterprise. The fleet entered a narrow channel
three leagues eastward of the town, and the troops landed on the
18th of April; but met with great opposition by a heavy fire of
musketry from the Spaniards, who were lodged behind a breastwork
on the beach. The FOURTEENTH were in flat-bottomed boats, pulled by
the Lascars of the Indiamen in which they had been conveyed. The
impetuosity of the men could not bear delay; but, leaping out of
the boats, and wading ashore, they soon drove the enemy from their
position, at the point of the bayonet. Lieutenant-Colonel Burnett
was ordered to pursue, with all possible speed, to endeavour to get
possession of the bridge which led over the river between the town
and the beach. So closely were the enemy pursued by the FOURTEENTH,
and particularly by the _Light Company_, that many threw away their
arms and accoutrements, and fairly ran for it: they succeeded in
gaining the bridge; and, as soon as the men of the FOURTEENTH
approached the tête-de-pont, the Spaniards blew up the bridge at
the moment when many of their own people were crossing it. The
destruction of the bridge obliged the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Ralph
Abercromby, to change his plan, which had, originally, been to
take the town by a coup-de-main. The next day, therefore, the army
began to erect batteries. The second day after their completion,
the enemy kept up such an incessant fire, that they succeeded in
dismounting two of the guns of one of the batteries, and otherwise
seriously injuring the works. A strong party was, therefore,
ordered out at night to repair the damage: this party consisted
of three hundred and fifty men, under the command of Captain
Powell, afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel and Major of the regiment,
of which number one hundred and fifty were to be employed in the
trenches, and two hundred were placed at some distance from the
battery to act as a covering party. The same night Major Ronald
Hamilton, of the FOURTEENTH, made an attempt to ford the river,
with a view of ascertaining if it were fordable for infantry; but,
being discovered, he was fired upon by an advanced sentry. This
creating some alarm, caused an irregular fire of musketry to be
carried on all night. Under cover of this, and of the darkness, a
party of five hundred Spaniards contrived to cross the river higher
up, and then descending along its edge, secreted themselves among
the brushwood between the river and the battery. At dawn of day a
serjeant and twelve men of the FOURTEENTH, who had been on piquet
in the bushes, were called in, and, at the very same moment, as if
by magic, the whole party of Spaniards rushed, in one dense mass,
into the battery.

Sir Ralph Abercromby, Colonel Hope, the Adjutant-General,
(afterwards Lord Niddry) Colonel Maitland, with the whole staff
of the Commander-in-Chief, had arrived, about an hour before, to
inspect the work, and were at the moment in the battery. The sudden
inrush of the Spaniards created surprise; and the increased number
of persons thus in the battery produced great confusion. The only
British who had arms were the twelve men from the piquet; but
all the Spaniards were provided with bayonets, or short swords,
evidently intended for the butchery of the whole working party.
For a short time it seemed as if they were to be utterly at the
mercy of the enemy; but, soon recovering themselves, they fell to
work with good will with shovels, pickaxes, and other implements
of labour, and that with such terrible effect, that every Spaniard
was either killed, or taken prisoner, before the covering party
could arrive to assist their comrades. The working party had five
men killed, and seventeen wounded. Captain Powell, and Lieutenants
Gibson and Wren, received thanks in general orders[13].

From Porto Rico the regiment again proceeded to Martinique, where
it was stationed upwards of three years.

[Sidenote: 1800]

Towards the end of the year 1800, the regiment relieved the
Seventieth Foot at Trinidad.

[Sidenote: 1802]

[Sidenote: 1803]

On the conclusion of the treaty of Amiens in 1802, Great Britain
gave up the captured possessions of France, Spain, and Holland. The
FOURTEENTH were relieved from duty in the West Indies in April,
1803, and returning to England, landed at Gosport, from whence they
marched to Winchester, under Captain Graves, who had performed the
duty of commanding officer nearly twelve months.

Previously to the arrival of the regiment in England, the short
respite from the horrors of war, granted by the treaty of Amiens,
had terminated; the ambitious designs of Bonaparte, First Consul of
France, had involved Great Britain in another contest, and orders
had been issued for augmenting the regular army. Every effort was
made to complete the establishment of the FOURTEENTH Foot, which
was attended with great success, and when Bonaparte assembled an
army for the invasion of England, the regiment marched to Silver
Hill Barracks, and afterwards to Winchelsea, where it was held in
readiness to repel the legions of France, had they ventured to
land on the British coast. At this momentous period the measures
of the government were nobly seconded by the people; a patriotic
enthusiasm pervaded the country; and the attitude the nation
assumed, with the strength and energy it evinced, while breathing
defiance to the gigantic military power by which it was menaced,
left no room for doubt respecting the result of the contest had
the French army attempted to carry into effect the threats of its
leader.

[Sidenote: 1804]

In 1804 the French army remained inactive at Boulogne, and Great
Britain preserved an attitude of defence. In the autumn of this
year a _second battalion_ was added to the FOURTEENTH Regiment.

[Sidenote: 1805]

The first battalion remained on the Sussex coast in readiness for
active service whenever it might be required. In the mean time
the French nation had conferred on its First Consul, Bonaparte,
the dignity of Emperor, and he was also crowned King of Italy. In
the autumn Napoleon reviewed his army at Boulogne, and afterwards
marched against the forces of Russia and Austria, to crush the
coalition forming against his interests in Germany. At this period
the French troops were withdrawn from Hanover, which country
they seized on resuming hostilities in 1803. Towards the end of
October, the first battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment embarked
for Hanover, where a body of British troops was assembled under
Lieutenant-General Lord Cathcart. The defeat of the Austrians
and Russians at Austerlitz, established the preponderance of the
French power on the continent for a short period, and in the treaty
concluded at Vienna soon afterwards, it was stipulated that Hanover
should be occupied by the Prussians. Under these circumstances the
troops under Lord Cathcart returned to England.

[Sidenote: 1806]

The first battalion landed from Hanover in February, 1806, and was
quartered in Kent.

On the decease of General Hotham, King George III. conferred the
colonelcy of the regiment on Major-General Sir Harry Calvert, from
the Fifth West India Regiment, by commission dated the 8th of
February, 1806.

In this year the second battalion proceeded to Ireland.

The first battalion was encamped at Shorncliffe, where it was
formed in brigade with the Ninth and Ninety-first Foot, under
Major-General Rowland Hill, (afterwards General Lord Hill); this
brigade was reviewed with the Forty-third Regiment by His Royal
Highness the Duke of York, who expressed his high approbation of
the appearance and discipline of the several corps. In December the
first battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment proceeded to Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1807]

After remaining in Ireland five months the first battalion returned
to England, and in June, 1807, it embarked under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel James Watson, for the East Indies, where it
arrived in November of the same year, and landed at Fort St.
George, Madras.

[Sidenote: 1808]

The influence of French councils at the court of Denmark, had
involved that country in hostilities with Great Britain, and
in the beginning of 1808 the first battalion of the FOURTEENTH
Regiment sailed from Madras with the expedition against the Danish
settlement of _Tranquebar_, situate at one of the mouths of the
Caveri river, in the Carnatic, which surrendered to the British
arms on the 8th of February, when Lieutenant Colonel Watson, with
the head quarters, returned to Madras, and shortly afterwards to
Bengal.

[Sidenote: 1809]

In the mean time important events had occurred in Europe, which
called the second battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment into active
service. After reducing Germany to submission to his will, and
forcing Russia to accede to his decrees, Napoleon was prompted
by his restless ambition to attempt the subjugation of Spain and
Portugal. The Spaniards and Portuguese rose in arms to assert
their national rights, and in the summer of 1808 Portugal was
delivered by a British army under Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur
Wellesley. In the autumn Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore received
orders to advance with a body of British troops from Portugal,
into the heart of Spain, at the same time several regiments were
sent from the United Kingdom to co-operate in this enterprise.
The second battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment, commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Jasper Nicolls, embarked from Cork for
Spain, and landed at Corunna, forming part of the force under
Lieutenant-General Sir David Baird. Advancing up the country, the
British troops encountered many difficulties and privations, and
the Spanish armies, with which they were directed to co-operate,
were defeated and dispersed by the legions of Napoleon, who had
three hundred thousand men in Spain. To confront this host of
veterans, the British general had not twenty-five thousand men;
yet, with that intrepidity for which he was always distinguished,
he advanced and menaced the enemy's lines. Sir David Baird's
division joined the troops under Sir John Moore on the 20th of
December, at Majorga, from whence the army advanced to Sahagun,
and preparations were made for attacking the French troops under
Marshal Soult; but information being received that Napoleon was
advancing at the head of an overwhelming force, the army retreated
towards the coast. In this retrograde movement of two hundred
and fifty miles, along roads covered with snow, over rivers and
mountains, and along narrow defiles, the troops endured privation
and suffering of various kinds; but the ability of their commander
was conspicuous, and the army arrived, unbroken, at _Corunna_, in
January, 1809. The soldiers obtained shelter, food, and repose in
the town and neighbouring villages, and their wasted strength was
recruited while they waited the arrival of shipping to transport
them to England.

The French army under Marshal Soult approaching, the British troops
formed for battle on a range of heights in front of Corunna; the
FOURTEENTH were formed in brigade with the Second, Fifth, and
Thirty-second Regiments, under Major-General (afterwards Lord)
Hill, and were posted towards the left of the position. On the
16th of January the French troops descended the mountains and
attacked the British position in three columns; the first column
carried the village of Elvina; then dividing, attempted to turn
the right of Lieutenant-General Sir David Baird's division by
the valley, and to break its front; the second column advanced
against the British centre, and the third attacked the left at the
village of Palavia Abaxo. The furious onsets of the enemy were
met and repulsed with a firmness and determination which proved
the unconquerable spirit and excellent discipline of the British
troops. The enemy finding his efforts unavailing on the right and
centre, determined to render the attack on the left more serious,
and succeeded in obtaining possession of Palavia Abaxo, the
village through which the great road to Madrid passes, and which
was situate in front of that part of the line; from this post the
French were, however, soon expelled, by a very gallant attack of
some companies of the second battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolls[14]. The enemy was repulsed
at all points, and the lustre of the British arms shone with
peculiar brilliance amidst the most disadvantageous circumstances;
but the army sustained the loss of its gallant commander,
Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore, who was mortally wounded during
the engagement.

Having defeated a French army of superior numbers, the British
troops withdrew on board the fleet. Major-General Hill's brigade
took up a position near the ramparts, leaving the piquets to keep
up the bivouac fires, to cover the embarkation, which was completed
with little loss, and the army returned to England.

The distinguished conduct of the FOURTEENTH Foot was afterwards
rewarded with the royal authority to bear the word "CORUNNA" on the
colours of the regiment.

The second battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment landed at
Portsmouth and Plymouth, from whence it proceeded to Buckingham;
and while stationed at that place, the county title of the regiment
was changed from "BEDFORDSHIRE" to "BUCKINGHAMSHIRE."

In the summer of this year a very powerful armament was fitted out
and placed under the orders of General the Earl of Chatham, for
an attack on Holland, and the second battalion of the FOURTEENTH
Regiment marched from Buckingham to Portsmouth, where it embarked
on this enterprise under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolls.
In the beginning of August it landed on the island of _Walcheren_,
situate in the German Ocean, near the mouth of the Scheldt, and
was employed in the siege of _Flushing_, the principal port on
the island. During the progress of the siege, the FOURTEENTH
evinced the same ardour and contempt of danger for which they
were distinguished at the battle of Corunna. On the evening of
the 12th of August they were directed to storm one of the Dutch
entrenchments in front of the position occupied by the troops under
Major-General Graham, and a detachment of the King's German Legion
co-operated in the attack. Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolls led the
FOURTEENTH to the assault with great gallantry, and the soldiers
rushed forward with so much spirit and resolution that they carried
the entrenchments in a few minutes, capturing one gun and thirteen
prisoners, and establishing a lodgment within musket-shot of the
walls of the town. This was accomplished with the loss of Ensign C.
Harold, and one private soldier, killed; four rank and file wounded.

On the following day the line of battle ships cannonaded the
town, which was soon in flames, presenting an awful scene of
destruction; in the evening one of the batteries was stormed
by the Thirty-sixth, Seventy-first, and light battalion of the
King's German Legion, and on the morning of the 15th of August the
garrison surrendered.

The FOURTEENTH were thanked in general orders for their
distinguished conduct.

Embarking from Flushing, the battalion was prepared to sail up the
river Scheldt for an attack on Antwerp; but the delays which took
place, gave the enemy time to prepare additional means of defence,
and an epidemic disease of a fatal character breaking out among the
troops, the enterprise was abandoned, and the FOURTEENTH returned
to England, and were quartered at Steyning.

The unhealthy climate of Walcheren produced a serious loss of
life among the troops left on that island, and the soldiers of
the FOURTEENTH having recovered from the effects of the epidemic,
embarked a second time for that station; they formed part of the
covering brigade when the stores, sick soldiers, &c., were removed,
on the final evacuation of that island.

[Sidenote: 1810]

In March, 1810, the second battalion embarked for Malta, but on
arriving at Gibraltar, it was ordered to land at that fortress,
and two companies, under Captain Everard and Captain Ramsay, were
detached to _Tariffa_, for the defence of that town against the
French: the two companies returned to Gibraltar in June, and the
battalion continued its voyage to Malta, where it arrived on the
23rd of that month.

In the autumn of this year the first battalion was withdrawn from
Bengal, to take part in the reduction of the _Isle of France_,
or the _Mauritius_, an important island belonging to France, and
situate in the Indian sea. The battalion sailed to Rodriguez, which
was the appointed rendezvous of the expedition, and on the 28th of
November the fleet came in sight of the Isle of France. The troops
landed in the bay of Mapou, and advanced through a thick wood,
skirmishing occasionally with the French. On diverging into the
open country, the British marched direct upon Port Louis, but the
soldiers suffering much from the want of water, the army halted
at the streams at the powder mills, five miles from the town.
Resuming the march on the following day, the troops were opposed
by the enemy in force, when some sharp fighting occurred, in which
the British soldiers were triumphant. The FOURTEENTH had one man
killed, and two wounded, on this occasion.

Having overcome all opposition, the British continued their march,
and took post in front of the enemy's lines before the town. On
the following morning the governor, General de Caen, agreed to
surrender the place to the British troops, under Major-General John
Abercromby. This valuable island was thus added to the possessions
of the British crown, and the FOURTEENTH were thanked in orders for
their conduct on this service.

After the capture of the Isle of France, the first battalion of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment proceeded to Madras, where it was stationed
several weeks.

[Sidenote: 1811]

In January, 1811, the flank companies of the second battalion
proceeded from Malta, to the island of Sicily, under the orders of
Captain Ramsay and Captain Light, to serve under Major-General Lord
William Bentinck.

After the capture of the Isle of France, the British government
resolved to complete its dominion in the East, by the conquest
of the island of _Java_, of which the Dutch had held undisturbed
possession for more than one hundred years. The extent of the
island,--six hundred and forty miles long, and about a hundred
broad; the luxuriant and fertile character of the soil, the
mountain districts yielding the vegetables and grain of Europe, and
the plains the delicious fruits and other valuable productions of
the East in abundance, without the necessity of laborious tillage,
and to so great an extent as to occasion it to be sometimes
called the granary of the East; rendered the island of Java a
valuable acquisition to the United Provinces, and its principal
city, Batavia, was the capital of the Dutch settlements in the
East Indies. Holland having become a part of that empire which
Napoleon was forming to prepare the way for universal dominion,
it became necessary to deprive the Dutch of the large and fertile
island of Java, and a body of troops was placed under the orders
of Lieutenant-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty for that purpose. In
this enterprise the first battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment
was employed, and the greater part of the officers and men were
re-embarked in March on board of the men-of-war ordered to cruise
off the island, in which service they had various opportunities of
distinguishing themselves, in destroying gun-boats, and in other
enterprises on the coast. On one occasion Lieutenant Gillman, who
commanded a party on board the boats of His Majesty's ship "Sir
Francis Drake," was killed. The conduct of a detachment under
Lieutenant J. H. Heyland, embarked in the sloop "Procris," engaged
in the boarding of some of the enemy's gun-boats, was highly
commended in the public despatch of Captain Maunsell, R.N.

Detachments consisting of the FOURTEENTH and Eighty-ninth
Regiments, Royal Marines, and seamen, were landed from His
Majesty's ship "Minden," near Bantam, on the coast of Java, and, in
two contests, defeated five hundred of the enemy's chosen troops,
which had been sent to Batavia to attack them. Captain Watson,
Lieutenants Rochfort, McLean, and L'Estrange, and Ensign Jennings,
of the FOURTEENTH, and Lieutenant Dunscombe of the Eighty-ninth,
particularly distinguished themselves on these occasions.

The head-quarters sailed from Madras on the 18th of April, 1811,
and landed on the 4th of August, at the village of Chillingching,
about twelve miles east of _Batavia_, towards which city the army
directed its march. The French and Dutch troops set fire to the
magazines in Batavia, and abandoned the city, which was taken
possession of by the British.

On the 10th of August the British advanced from Batavia, and found
three thousand select men of the Gallo-Batavian troops in a strong
position, defended by _abattis_ behind _Weltefreden_; and this post
was stormed and carried at the point of the bayonet, many of the
enemy being killed, and the remainder retreating to the entrenched
position at _Cornelis_, between the great river Jacatra, and the
deep aqueduct of Slaken. The conduct of Captain Stannus commanding
the light infantry company of the FOURTEENTH, and of Lieutenant
Coghlan, commanding the rifle company, was highly commended in
Colonel Gillespie's report of this action. The regiment had Ensign
Nickisson and three rank and file wounded.

In the strong position of _Cornelis_ more than ten thousand
Gallo-Batavian troops were assembled, and they were greatly
superior in numbers to the British force. This formidable position
was, however, stormed on the 26th of August, and the invincible
prowess of the assailants overcame all opposition; the British were
triumphant at every point; nearly two thousand of the enemy were
killed, and about five thousand prisoners were taken, including
three general officers. The remainder of the enemy dispersed,
excepting a few men, who accompanied the Gallo-Batavian commander,
General Jansens, in his flight. The FOURTEENTH distinguished
themselves on this occasion, and the conduct of their commanding
officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Watson, was commended in the official
account of the action given by Colonel Gillespie.

The victory of Cornelis terminated the Dutch sovereignty of Java;
General Jansens was pursued up the country; and on the 16th of
September, the FOURTEENTH were engaged in storming the fortified
position at _Jattoo_, when the remainder of the Gallo-Batavian
force was routed; General Jansens was afterwards forced to
surrender, and this valuable island was annexed to the dominions of
the British Crown. It was restored to Holland, at the termination
of the war, by the Treaty of Vienna in 1814.

The loss of the FOURTEENTH Foot at the storming of Fort Cornelis
was Captain Marinus Kennedy, two serjeants, and nine rank and file,
killed; Major George Miller, Captain Trevor Stannus, Lieutenants W.
H. Coghlan and Kenneth McKenzie, seven serjeants, and eighty-three
rank and file, wounded; one rank and file missing.

Lieutenant-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty stated in his public
despatch, "The superior discipline and invincible courage which
have so highly distinguished the British army, were never more
fully displayed, and I have the heartfelt pleasure to add, that
they have not been clouded by any acts of insubordination."

The commanding officer of the FOURTEENTH, Lieutenant-Colonel
Watson, (now Lieutenant-General SIR JAMES WATSON, K.C.B., colonel
of the regiment,) was rewarded with a gold medal; and the word
"JAVA" was placed, by royal authority, on the colours of the
regiment to commemorate its distinguished services at the capture
of that island, which was the most splendid acquisition made by
the British arms in 1811. The strength of the first battalion at
the capture of Java was forty-eight officers, and one thousand one
hundred and forty-five non-commissioned officers and soldiers.

[Sidenote: 1812]

After the capture of Java the FOURTEENTH remained on the island
for some time. The Sultan of Mataram, who governed a portion of
the interior, trusting to his power, and the strength of his
fortified palace, at _Djoojocarta_, meditated the expulsion of
all Europeans from the island, and committed aggressions of which
it became necessary to stop the progress. To effect this, his
palace was captured by storm on the morning of the 20th of June,
1812; on which occasion the FOURTEENTH had another occasion of
distinguishing themselves. Lieutenant-Colonel Watson commanded the
main attack, and the grenadiers of the regiment headed the assault
in their usual gallant style[15]. Colonel Gillespie, commanding the
forces in Java, stated in orders,

"To Lieutenant-Colonel Watson, who commanded the leading column,
the commander of the forces cannot convey the sense he entertains
of his distinguished bravery, and of the quickness and celerity
with which he conceived and executed the attack.

"The animated style in which Captain Johnstone and Lieutenant
Hunter crossed the ditch, at the head of the FOURTEENTH grenadiers,
and escaladed the ramparts, under the fire of the east bastion,
could only be equalled by the order and zeal of their followers."

The conduct of Lieutenant Hill, and of Lieutenant McLean, of the
regiment was also commended.

Eight rank and file of the regiment were killed. Lieutenant McLean
died of his wounds, and thirty rank and file were wounded.

[Sidenote: 1813]

An expedition was fitted out, in 1813, consisting of a detachment
of the FOURTEENTH Regiment, and of the troops in the service of the
Honourable the East India Company; and placed under the orders of
Lieutenant-Colonel Watson of the FOURTEENTH, for the attack of the
piratical state of _Sambas_, on the western coast of the island
of Borneo, which terminated in the surrender of the town, after a
sharp conflict in which Captain Watson and Lieutenant Jennings were
wounded; the capture of all the batteries, fortified posts, and
defences of the Sultan, and the complete discomfiture of Pangerang
Anom and his adherents. The first battalion proceeded to Bengal in
October, 1813.

In the mean time the war in Europe was prosecuted with great
vigour; the British troops were victorious in the Peninsula, and
every effort was made to bring a powerful army into the field.
At this period a _third battalion_ was added to the FOURTEENTH
Regiment of Foot; it was raised by volunteers from the Militia and
assembled at Weedon under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel the
Honorable James Stewart, and was soon in a condition fit for active
service.

[Sidenote: 1814]

After a contest of twenty years, the period of the downfall of that
gigantic power, which had sprung out of the French revolution,
arrived; the snow storms of the winter of 1812-13, had annihilated
the French army in Russia; the British army, which had delivered
Portugal and Spain from the tyrannical rule of Napoleon, was
following up its career of victory in the heart of France; at
the same time the forces of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and other
continental states, were invading France. Thus a favourable
opportunity presented itself; one powerful effort appeared likely
to overthrow Napoleon and his adherents, and at this important
juncture, (the spring of 1814,) the third battalion of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment received orders to hold itself in readiness
for foreign service, and commenced its march for the coast; at
the same time the second battalion was withdrawn from the island
of Malta, to join the expedition, under Lieutenant-General Lord
William Bentinck, against the north-west coast of Italy. This
expedition captured several places, including the maritime city of
_Genoa_, once a celebrated republic, now the capital of a province
in the Sardinian States. The progress of the British arms in Italy
was suddenly arrested by the termination of the war: Napoleon
Bonaparte abdicated; Louis XVIII. ascended the throne of France;
and the nations of Europe hailed the event as the great jubilee
of Christendom. The embarkation of the third battalion of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment was countermanded, and after some delay, the
second battalion was placed in quarters at the city of Genoa, where
it remained twelve months.

Towards the end of the year the third battalion was held in
readiness to embark for North America; circumstances connected with
the trade of neutral nations, during the war with France, having
involved Great Britain in hostilities with the United States.
Before the battalion quitted England, peace was concluded with
the United States, when the order for its proceeding abroad was
countermanded, and directions were given for its being disbanded on
the 24th of March, 1815.

[Sidenote: 1815]

In the spring of 1815, while the Congress at Vienna was deciding
on the boundaries of kingdoms, and the people of all countries
were looking forward to a period of peace, Bonaparte suddenly
violated his engagements, re-appeared in France, and the French
army declaring in his favour, he reascended the throne he had
abdicated. War was immediately declared against the usurper; the
order for disbanding the third battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment
was consequently rescinded, and on the 21st of March, (three days
before the date fixed upon for its being disbanded,) the battalion
received directions to embark for Flanders: it landed at Ostend on
the 31st of March, and formed part of the army commanded by His
Royal Highness the Prince of Orange.

Additional forces were sent to Flanders, Field Marshal his Grace
the Duke of Wellington assumed the command, and the third battalion
of the FOURTEENTH Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel FRANCIS
S. TIDY, (Major of the regiment,) was formed in brigade with the
Twenty-third Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and Fifty-first Light Infantry
under Colonel Mitchel, and constituted part of the fourth division,
commanded by Lieutenant-General the Honorable Sir Charles Colville,
K.C.B.

Bonaparte attempted, by one of those rapid advances for which he
had always been celebrated, to interpose between the British and
Prussian armies, and on the 16th of June the battles of Ligny and
Quatre Bras were fought: the British were victorious; but the
Prussians were defeated; and the Duke of Wellington retreated,
on the 17th of June, to the position in front of the village of
Waterloo, to preserve his communication with Prince Blucher.

On the 18th of June the third battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment
had the honour to take part in the memorable battle of _Waterloo_,
the character and importance of which engagement, distinguish it
as the greatest event of the age, and mark it as the brightest era
in the history of the British army. The battalion was composed of
young soldiers, who had never before been under fire, but their
bearing reflected honour on the corps to which they belonged.
During the heat of the conflict, when the thunder of cannon and
musketry, the occasional explosion of caissons, the hissing of
balls, shells, and grape shot, the clash of arms, the impetuous
noise and shouts of the soldiery, produced a scene of carnage
and confusion impossible to describe, a staff officer rode up to
Lieutenant-Colonel Tidy, and directed him to form square; this
was scarcely completed when the glittering arms of a regiment of
cuirassiers were seen issuing from the smoke. The French horsemen
paused for a moment at the sight of the scarlet uniforms of the
FOURTEENTH, and then turned to the right to attack a regiment of
Brunswickers; but a volley from the Brunswick square repulsed
the enemy, and Lieutenant-Colonel Tidy, with the view of giving
confidence to the young soldiers of the FOURTEENTH, drew their
attention to the facility with which infantry could repulse
cavalry. The French cuirassiers rallied, and appeared inclined
to charge the FOURTEENTH, but were intimidated by the steady and
determined bearing of the battalion.

The cavalry attacks on the British line were particularly severe,
and were supported by large bodies of troops of all arms; the
infantry pressing forward, while dragoons, lancers, carabineers,
and cuirassiers advanced in overwhelming numbers, threatening
to bear down all opposition; masking at times the advance of
infantry; charging the British squares, and when repulsed, quickly
re-forming; while individuals, spurred on by an ardent but
unavailing intrepidity, were observed searching for an opening in
the British battalions by which to penetrate, and usually perishing
in the vain attempt. Repulsed at all points, Bonaparte resolved
to make a last desperate effort, and brought forward his reserve,
consisting of the old imperial guards; but these chosen bands were
overthrown and annihilated; and the whole British army rushing
forward upon the enemy, completed the overthrow of the legions of
Bonaparte, which were driven from the field of battle with the loss
of all their cannon, baggage, and the _materiel_ of their army.

Thus was a victory, the most complete and decisive, achieved by
the army under the Duke of Wellington: the British soldiers halted
on the field of battle surrounded by their ensanguined trophies:
they had decided the political destiny of the world, and ensured
national independence to the kingdoms of Europe!

In congratulating the regiments of the fourth brigade, in the
share they had in achieving the glorious victory at Waterloo,
Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Colville observed,--"the
Twenty-third and Fifty-first Regiments fully maintained their
former high character, whilst the very young THIRD BATTALION OF THE
FOURTEENTH, in this its first trial, displayed a steadiness and
gallantry becoming of veteran troops." The loss of the battalion
was seven rank and file killed; Ensign Alfred Cooper, four
serjeants, and sixteen rank and file, wounded.

The royal authority was afterwards given for the regiment to bear
the word "WATERLOO" on its colors, to commemorate the share it
had in gaining this splendid victory. Lieutenant-Colonel Tidy was
rewarded with the dignity of Companion of the Bath; and every
officer and soldier received a silver medal, with the privilege of
reckoning two years' service for that day.

On the morning of the 19th of June, the British troops advanced
in pursuit of the wreck of the French army; and on entering
France, the Duke of Wellington invited Louis XVIII. to repair
to Cateau Cambresis. Being desirous of not exposing the King's
person, the British commander directed _Cambray_ to be summoned;
but this fortress refused to surrender, and repulsed the troops
which approached the town on the 23rd of June. On the following
day orders for attacking the place by escalade were issued, and
the third battalion of the FOURTEENTH, with the Twenty-third and
Fifty-first Regiments, were directed to make a feint attack on the
Paris gate; but the gallantry of the officers and soldiers turned
the feint into a real attack, and they were in possession of the
town before the other brigades of the fourth division could force
an entrance. The citadel of Cambray surrendered on the 25th of June.

The army continued its advance upon Paris, which city surrendered
in the early part of July, and the war was terminated with the
restoration of Louis XVIII. to the throne of France.

During this period, the second battalion had remained at the
city of Genoa, on the north-west coast of Italy, from whence
it was ordered to Marseilles, in France, under the command of
Major-General Lowe, and it landed at that port on the 12th of
July. At this period Bonaparte was at Rochefort, endeavouring to
effect his escape to North America; but being prevented by the
British cruizers, he surrendered to Captain Maitland, commanding
the "Bellerophon" man of war, thus closing his political career.
On the conclusion of the treaties of peace which followed these
events, the battalion embarked from Marseilles for the island of
Malta, where it arrived in January, 1816.

The third battalion remained in the vicinity of Paris several
months; it was present at the reviews of the army, in the plain
of St. Denis and Champs Elysees, by the Emperors of Russia and
Austria, and the Kings of Prussia and France, and on the formation
of the army of occupation, it returned to England: it was disbanded
at Deal, on the 17th of February, 1816; the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers fit for duty being transferred to the first
and second battalions.

The first battalion of the FOURTEENTH Regiment was stationed at
the military cantonment of Berhampore, from whence it marched,
in the beginning of 1815, and joined the army assembled under
Major-General George Wood, in consequence of the war with the
kingdom of _Nepaul_. The Nepaulese were soon reduced to submission,
and in April, the FOURTEENTH proceeded to the military cantonment
of Dinapore, situated on the south bank of the river Ganges, in
the province of Bahar, where they remained until October, when
they embarked in boats, and proceeded to the cantonments near the
ancient Hindoo town of Cawnpore, on the west bank of the Ganges, in
the province of Allahabad.

[Sidenote: 1816]

On the 26th of April, 1816, the second battalion embarked from
Malta, for the Ionian Islands, where it was stationed during the
following seventeen months.

The first battalion remained at Cawnpore during the whole of this
year.

[Sidenote: 1817]

In the mean time the resistance made by a powerful Hindoo Zemindar,
or landholder, who possessed the town and fort of _Hatrass_, in
the province of Agra, occasioned the regiment once more to take
the field in India, in the beginning of 1817. This Zemindar was
named Dyaram; during the troubles in the province of Agra, he
only paid his rents when threatened with a large military force,
and in the year 1803, when the country between the rivers Jumna
and Ganges, called the Dooab, was taken possession of by the
British, he expressed himself willing to pay his assessment, but
objected to any interference in what he called his territory. This
was not agreed to, but he was not then molested. His refusing to
acknowledge the authority of the civil law, afterwards rendered
it necessary to bring him to obedience by force of arms, and
he had the presumption to defy the British power. To reduce
this refractory Zemindar, a body of troops was placed under
Major-General Sir Dyson Marshall, and the first battalion of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment took part in the enterprise. The fortified
town of Hatrass was reputed of great strength, and when the
troops arrived before it, in February, 1817, some inquiry was
made respecting the depth of the ditch, which a soldier of the
FOURTEENTH, volunteered to ascertain, and fastening a large stone
to the end of a cord, he proceeded alone after dark, and gained the
necessary information, with a cool intrepidity, exposed to such
great danger, as created great surprise. The fire of the batteries
soon forced the town to submit, when it was taken possession of
by Lieutenant-Colonel Watson, and the FOURTEENTH; but the castle
held out several days; at length the principal magazine exploded,
and during the following night the refractory Dyaram escaped at
the head of a hundred horsemen all in complete armour. The castle
was afterwards taken possession of without opposition; and this
was followed by the submission of all the zemindars of the Dooab.
After the performance of this service the FOURTEENTH returned to
Cawnpore, where they remained several months.

The second battalion embarked from Cephalonia in the autumn of
this year, and proceeded to Malta, where it remained a few days.
The peace of Europe appearing to be established upon a firm basis,
a reduction in the army took place, which occasioned the second
battalion to receive orders to return to England for the purpose of
being disbanded; it landed at Portsmouth on the 24th and 25th of
November, and was reduced at Chichester on the 23rd of December,
transferring four hundred and twenty rank and file to the first
battalion.

[Sidenote: 1818]

The aggressions of the bands of _Pindarees_, who made incursions
into the territory subject to Great Britain, and committed great
depredations, occasioned the regiment to be again called into the
field in October of this year. Colonel Watson having received the
appointment of Brigadier-General, and been nominated to a command
under Major-General Sir Dyson Marshall, the command of the regiment
devolved on Major Johnstone. The Pindarees were a community of
professed marauders, and they were encouraged to make ravages in
the British dominions in India, by the Mahratta states. Being all
horsemen subsisting by plunder, the services of the corps employed
against them were of an arduous and trying character:--traversing
extensive districts by forced marches, passing rivers and thickets,
and attempting to surprise these bands of plunderers, were duties
calculated to exhaust the strength of European soldiers, when
performed under an Indian sun. The regiment continued actively
employed on these services until April, 1818, when it proceeded to
the military cantonment of Meerut.

[Sidenote: 1819]

[Sidenote: 1825]

At the pleasant quarters of Meerut, situated on an extensive grass
plain, the regiment was stationed during the seven following years,
and it preserved a high reputation for good conduct in quarters,
while employed in this part of India. Events, however, occurred in
1825, which occasioned it to take the field, when it had another
opportunity of gaining laurels in combat with the enemies of Great
Britain, under the following circumstances:

The Rajah of _Bhurtpore_, Baldeo Singh, had become attached to the
English government, with which he formed an alliance, offensive
and defensive, and procured a guarantee for the succession of his
youthful son, Bhulwunt Singh, to the throne; but amongst many of
the rajah's subjects, a strong feeling of hostility to the British
existed, particularly in the army, and his nephew, Doorjun Sal,
was at the head of the party opposed to the British alliance.
After the rajah's decease his nephew excited a rebellion, gained
possession of the capital, and assumed the sovereign power. To
fulfil the engagements made with the deceased rajah, by removing
the usurper, and placing the youthful prince on the throne, a
British army was assembled under General Viscount Combermere, and
in November, 1825, the FOURTEENTH Foot, mustering upwards of nine
hundred officers and soldiers, were withdrawn from Meerut, to join
the division assembling at Muttra, for the purpose of engaging in
this enterprise. The most important part of this war, it was well
known, would consist in the siege of the capital, the fortified
city of Bhurtpore; and great confidence being placed by the natives
in the strength of this place, from which a British army under
Lord Lake had been forced to retire in 1805, after a short siege,
a body of troops was assembled, and a train of artillery brought
forward, such as have seldom taken the field in Indian warfare. The
FOURTEENTH, commanded by Major Matthias Everard, were formed in
brigade with the Twenty-third and Sixty-third Regiments of Native
Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel John M'Combe, of the FOURTEENTH,
who had the rank of brigadier-general; Lieutenant-Colonel W. T.
Edwards, of the FOURTEENTH Regiment, also commanded a brigade, with
the rank of brigadier-general.

On the 10th and 11th of December the British army appeared before
the celebrated city and fortress of BHURTPORE, which contained
a garrison nearly equal in numbers to the besieging force. The
Bhurtporees had cut a sluice into the embankment of a lake near
the town, to fill the ditch round the works with water, but they
were speedily driven from the spot; the sluice was stopped, the
embankment was turned into a military post, which was intrusted to
a company of the FOURTEENTH Foot, and some Sepoys: about eighteen
inches of water, only, had flowed into the ditch, and this sudden
seizure of the embankment facilitated the progress of the siege by
keeping the ditch nearly empty. The several corps took up their
ground; the investment became complete, several reconnoisances
were made, and working parties cut down orange and date trees
from the groves, and converted them into fascines and gabions. At
an early hour on the morning of the 24th of December the fires
of two batteries were opened on the town; additional works were
constructed, the batteries became more numerous, and the siege was
prosecuted with vigour; each successive day giving birth to fresh
undertakings, and the progress, though tardy, becoming hourly more
and more perceptible. It was, however, found particularly difficult
to effect practicable breaches in the singularly constructed walls
of Bhurtpore, which were thickly studded, in many places, with
large trees of a peculiarly tough description of timber, which
resisted shot with remarkable pertinacity. The process of mining
was adopted, several explosions took place, and the result soon
rendered it evident to every one present that the horrors of an
assault were drawing near. The Bhurtporees, however, evinced great
bravery and perseverance, exposing themselves to the fire of the
besieging force with singular resolution; they built up in the
night the works which were knocked down during the day, labouring
under a ceaseless fire, and evincing a firm determination to
persevere in the defence. The roar of cannon and musketry continued
day and night like a ceaseless peal of thunder; and the explosions
of the mines deafened, for an instant, all who were near the place.

[Sidenote: 1826]

Considerable progress having been made towards effecting
practicable breaches, the FOURTEENTH Regiment received orders
to prepare to lead one of the attacks at the storming of this
celebrated fortress, and at two o'clock on the morning of the
18th of January, 1826, it marched to the front opposite the left
bastion, to await the explosion of a mine. The FOURTEENTH and
FIFTY-NINTH Regiments had the honour of being selected to head
the two attacks, and they were directed to wheel as soon as they
had entered the breaches, one to the right and the other to the
left, and, continuing their career round the ramparts, to drive
the enemy before them till they met. Some delay occurred in the
mine, and the soldiers stood seven hours anxiously waiting for
the moment to commence the assault, during which time the thunder
of the artillery was tremendous. General Lord Combermere arrived
at the spot where the FOURTEENTH were formed, and seeing the
mouth of the mine near, he anxiously enquired if all was safe,
to which the engineer replied in the affirmative. His lordship
returned soon afterwards, and repeated the question, when he was
again assured that all was safe. In a few minutes afterwards the
bastion, beneath which the mine had been formed, heaved, as if by
the power of an earthquake; the ponderous wall rocked to and fro,
and then sunk down again, when, with a sound far exceeding the
loudest thunder, the exploding mine rent the massive bastion into
fragments, forcing stones, logs of wood, guns, men, and earth, into
the air, with a violence which it is impossible to describe, and
filling the atmosphere for a considerable distance with so dense
a cloud of smoke, dust, and fragments of the ruined bastion, that
it was difficult to breathe. Brigadier M'Combe was stunned, and
several soldiers of the FOURTEENTH were injured by the falling
fragments and bursting mine. As soon as the tremendous crash was
over, the soldiers rushed through the cloud of smoke and dust, and
began to ascend the breach, led by Majors Everard and Bisshopp;
they encountered some opposition, but nothing could withstand the
bayonets of the Grenadiers of the FOURTEENTH,--their valour soon
overpowered all resistance, and the regiment gained the summit with
little loss. The native corps appointed to support the regiment
not being near, a short pause ensued, when the enemy opened a
heavy fire from the buildings near the breach. Undaunted by this,
the FOURTEENTH dashed forward, cleared the walls as they went,
and, turning to the right, they drove the enemy from bastion to
bastion, and from tower to tower, with astonishing intrepidity and
success, capturing a colour which was on one of the bastions. The
enemy sprang a mine, which killed several soldiers of the regiment;
the Bhurtpore artillerymen fought with great desperation, and the
defenders of the walls evinced much personal bravery, but they
could not withstand the superior prowess and discipline of the
British troops.

As the FOURTEENTH were scouring the ramparts, and overcoming all
opposition in gallant style, they arrived at the Anah gate, where
they met the soldiers of the FIFTY-NINTH, who had turned to the
left at the breach, and proved victorious over every opponent; it
was a moment of intense interest, and a scene of glorious emotions:
BHURTPORE was won! the stain of a former repulse was wiped from the
British arms, and they hailed each other with a hearty and cordial
cheer.

The light company of the FOURTEENTH, which mounted the breach
with the grenadiers, pursued, with other troops, a body of the
enemy towards the citadel, which they nearly entered with the
fugitives; four hundred Bhurtporees were shut out, and bayonetted
at the gate. The citadel surrendered a few hours afterwards;
the commander-in-chief entered it at the head of the FOURTEENTH
Regiment, which he placed in garrison, as a compliment to the
corps for its extraordinary gallantry: thus was accomplished the
capture of this celebrated city, which was regarded throughout the
East as impregnable, the natives being accustomed to remark that
India was not subdued, because Bhurtpore had not fallen. That boast
was rendered futile, and every native prince had a clear evidence
that neither the number of his troops, nor the strength of his
fortresses, would avail against the superior valour and discipline
of the British forces.

The usurper, Doorjun Sal, was captured while attempting to escape,
and was sent prisoner to Allahabad; the young Rajah, Bhulwunt
Singh, was taken to the palace of his ancestors, and seated on
the throne, in the presence of the FOURTEENTH REGIMENT; and the
other towns of his dominions submitted. Thus was the cloud which
darkened the horizon of British India dispersed, and the splendour
of the British arms received additional lustre in the East. Lord
Combermere stated in his public despatch,--"I have the pleasure
to acquaint your lordship, that the conduct of every one engaged
was marked by a degree of zeal which calls for my unqualified
approbation; but I must particularly remark the behaviour of His
Majesty's FOURTEENTH Regiment, commanded by Major EVERARD, and
FIFTY-NINTH, commanded by Major FULLER; these corps having led the
columns of assault, by their steadiness and determination decided
the fate of the day."

In division orders it was stated,--"Major-General Reynell
congratulates the troops of his division, European and Native,
engaged in the storming of Bhurtpore this morning, upon the
brilliant success which attended their gallant exertions. It is
impossible for him to convey half what he feels in appreciating
the conduct of His Majesty's FOURTEENTH Regiment, that led the
principal storming column. It has impressed his mind with stronger
notions of what a British Regiment is capable of, when led by such
officers as Major Everard, Major Bisshopp, and Captain Mackenzie,
than he ever before possessed. The Major-General requests that
Major Everard will assure the officers and soldiers of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment, that they more than realized his expectations."

Lieutenant-Colonel W. T. Edwards, of the FOURTEENTH, an officer of
high character and lofty promise, fell at the head of the second
brigade, pierced by many wounds; Captain Henry B. Armstrong was
also mortally wounded while leading his men to victory on the
ramparts. The regiment had likewise two serjeants, twenty-nine
rank and file, and three Lascars, killed; Lieutenant-Colonel John
M'Combe, Lieutenants Richard Stack, Robert Daly, and Edward C.
Lynch, Volunteer W. Tulloh, two serjeants, ninety-eight rank and
file, and three Lascars, wounded.

Colonel John M'Combe[16], who commanded the first brigade, and
Major Matthias Everard, who commanded the regiment, were rewarded
with the dignity of Companion of the Bath; and the Royal authority
was afterwards given for the word "BHURTPORE" to be borne on the
regimental colour, to commemorate its gallantry on this occasion.

The war having terminated, the regiment returned to the cantonment
of Meerut, where it was stationed upwards of six months.

General Sir Harry Calvert, Baronet, G.C.B., died in September,
1826, when King George IV. conferred the colonelcy of the regiment
on General Thomas Lord Lynedoch, G.C.B.

[Sidenote: 1827]

The regiment left Meerut in October; it subsequently embarked in
boats, and, after a tedious passage down the river Ganges, arrived
at Fort William in the beginning of 1827; and was stationed at that
fortress twelve months.

[Sidenote: 1828]

[Sidenote: 1829]

Early in 1828 the regiment quitted Fort William, and proceeded to
the cantonment at Berhampore, where it was stationed during the
year 1829.

[Sidenote: 1830]

[Sidenote: 1831]

After performing the important duty of guarding the colonial
possessions of Great Britain in India twenty-three years,
the FOURTEENTH Regiment received orders to prepare to return
to England; it left Berhampore in November, and proceeded to
Fort William; the men who volunteered to remain in India were
transferred to other corps; and in December, 1830, and January,
1831, it embarked from Calcutta for England. It landed at Gravesend
in May and July,--was stationed at Chatham until September,--and at
Albany Barracks during the remainder of the year.

[Sidenote: 1832]

In the early part of 1832, the regiment was stationed at Haslar
Barracks, from whence it proceeded to Portsmouth, where it remained
five months. In the middle of July it embarked for Ireland, and
after landing at Cork, marched from thence to Buttevant.

[Sidenote: 1833]

[Sidenote: 1834]

In 1833 the head-quarters were removed to Athlone; in 1834 to
Dublin, and afterwards to Mullingar.

[Sidenote: 1835]

General Lord Lynedoch having been removed to the First, the Royal,
Regiment of Foot, King William IV. conferred the colonelcy of the
regiment on Lieutenant-General the Honorable Sir Charles Colville,
G.C.B., G.C.H., by commission, dated the 12th of December, 1834.
This officer was removed to the Fifth Fusiliers in March, 1835,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Regiment
by Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Hope, G.C.B., who, as
lieutenant-colonel, commanded the regiment in 1795.

The head-quarters were removed to Dundalk in the summer of 1835.

[Sidenote: 1836]

Five years had not elapsed from the period of the return of the
regiment from India, when it received orders to prepare for
embarkation for the West Indies. It was divided into six service
and four depôt companies; the service companies embarked from
Cork in February, 1836, arrived, in March, at Barbadoes, and were
removed, in April, to the island of St Kitt's.

[Sidenote: 1837]

In February, 1837, the service companies were removed to Antigua.

On the 19th of May, General the Honorable Sir Alexander Hope,
G.C.B., Lieutenant Governor of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea,
died, and was succeeded in the colonelcy by Lieutenant-General Sir
James Watson, K.C.B., who had commanded the regiment in India,
as lieutenant-colonel, from the year 1807 to 1821, when he was
promoted to the rank of major-general.

In June the depôt companies embarked from Waterford for England,
and, landing at Bristol, proceeded from thence to Brecon.

[Sidenote: 1838]

During the year 1838, the service companies remained at Antigua.

The distinguished services of the FOURTEENTH Regiment in India,
from 1807 to 1831, having been, at the special request of
Lieutenant-General Sir James Watson, brought before Her Majesty by
the Commander-in-Chief, the Royal authority was given for the badge
of the "ROYAL TIGER," superscribed "INDIA," to be borne upon the
regimental colour and appointments, to commemorate its services in
that part of Her Majesty's dominions.

[Sidenote: 1839]

[Sidenote: 1840]

In December[17] orders were received for the removal of the service
companies from Antigua to St. Lucia, where they arrived in the
beginning of January, 1839: in April, 1840, they proceeded to
Barbadoes, and in June to Trinidad. They suffered severely on these
stations from yellow fever and other effects of a tropical climate.

The depôt companies proceeded from England to Ireland in June, 1840.

[Sidenote: 1841]

The regiment remained at Trinidad until the early part of 1841,
when it was removed to Barbadoes. On the 27th of April it embarked
from Barbadoes for Lower Canada, and landed at Quebec on the 2nd of
June following.

[Sidenote: 1845]

The depôt companies were removed from Ireland to England, in
December, 1844; and the service companies have remained in Canada
until the year 1845, the period of the completion of this Record.

Among the splendid achievements of valour with which the annals of
the British army abound, the gallant behaviour of the FOURTEENTH
FOOT, on several occasions, appears conspicuous for those bright
qualities of intrepidity and heroism which distinguish the
inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland when arrayed under the
standard of their Sovereign; and the conduct of this corps in
quarters has been marked by those excellent features of order,
subordination, and discipline, which adorn the character of
the British soldier, procuring for him the admiration of the
inhabitants of all countries. The inscriptions on the colour of the
regiment bear testimony of the estimation in which its services
have been held by its Sovereign; and the reports of the general
officers, under whom it has served, have procured for it the
confidence of the Government and the Country.

"The breeches to be buff.

"The Grenadiers to have black bear-skin caps, fronted with red, the
motto and horse white metal.

[4] "The British troops who had this opportunity of distinguishing
themselves were the brigade of the line, viz., the FOURTEENTH,
Thirty-seventh, and Fifty-third Regiments, with the battalion
formed from the Light Infantry and Grenadier companies, under the
command of Major-General Abercromby; seven pieces of cannon and two
hundred prisoners were taken in the redoubts."--_London Gazette._

[5] Lieutenant Richard Goodall Elrington received a musket-ball
in the right thigh: after the wound was healed, he returned to
his duty, when an abscess formed in the left thigh from which the
ball was extracted; it having passed, in the flesh, from the right
to the left side of his body, and sunk down the thigh to the spot
where the abscess formed. This officer entered the army as an
ensign in 1790; was promoted from a lieutenantcy in the FOURTEENTH
to be captain in the First West India Regiment in 1795: was removed
to the Forty-seventh Regiment in 1803, and was promoted to the
lieut.-colonelcy in June, 1813: he continued in command of the
Forty-seventh Regiment until November, 1841, when he attained the
rank of major-general. He died in London on 2nd August, 1845.

[6] Afterwards lieutenant-colonel of the Forty-eighth Regiment.
Mr. Gilbert Cimitiere was appointed to an ensigncy in the Sixth
West India Regiment on 1st July, 1795; promoted to a lieutenantcy
in the Forty-eighth Regiment on the 15th June, 1796; in which he
attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in 1824. He retired from
the service in 1827.

[7] "Major-General Fox, with the FOURTEENTH, Thirty-seventh, and
Fifty-third Regiments, was engaged with the whole of the French
column which had marched from Lisle, and the different corps which
had driven the rest of the army back fell upon his flanks and
rear; perhaps there is _not on record a single instance of greater
gallantry_ or more soldier-like conduct than was exhibited on that
day, by these three regiments. At length General Fox, finding that
the whole army had left him, began to think of retreating, to
effect which it was necessary to get possession of the causeway
leading to Leers; but before that could be accomplished he was
obliged to charge several battalions of the enemy, who were
astonished that such a handful of men should presume to give
them battle, and expected every moment that they would lay down
their arms; but with _a degree of intrepidity that words cannot
describe_, and is, indeed, scarcely conceivable, they gained the
wished-for point, and then formed with such regularity that the
enemy could not assail them: they secured their retreat towards
Leers, and the next morning joined General Otto's column."--CAPTAIN
JONES' _Journal_.

[8] While the troops were forming outside the village, a hare
ran across the line, a man named Tovey knocked it down with his
musket, and placed it in his haversack, with surprising coolness,
although under so heavy a fire that it was difficult to form the
men, from the frequent and numerous casualties which occurred; thus
exemplifying that distinguished feature in the character of the
British soldier, "cool and collected in the midst of danger."

[9] Private Ryan served many years afterwards with deep marks in
his cheeks.

[10] "The Duke of York detached seven Austrian battalions, and the
second brigade of British infantry, (FOURTEENTH, _Thirty-seventh_,
and _Fifty-third_,) under Major-General Fox, who, though they had
lost so many men only four days before, anxiously wished to get
into action. Nothing could exceed their spirit and perseverance;
they stormed the village of Pontechin, and after firing a few shot
rushed with fixed bayonets into the heart of the enemy, and turned
the fate of the day once more in favour of the allies. The charge
was conducted with such skill and activity that it immediately
threw the enemy into confusion, and forced them to give way. At
this time the artillery came into action and directed their fire
so well, and followed it up with such activity, the enemy could
never be rallied so as to renew the attack, although they had
fresh troops constantly coming up, but continued to lose ground
till dark. Such a battle has seldom been fought; the enemy was in
action, under an incessant fire of cannon and musketry, upwards
of twelve hours, and left twelve thousand dead in the field, five
hundred taken, and seven pieces of cannon.

"The loss of the allies, in this memorable action, amounted to four
thousand men; one hundred and ninety-six were British, and all,
except three, from General Fox's brigade. It is a fact, although it
appears almost impossible, that _a single British brigade, and that
brigade less than six hundred men, on that great day, absolutely
won the battle_; for had it not come up, the allies would have been
beaten."--CAPTAIN JONES' _Journal_.

[11] Every man of the FOURTEENTH was proud of the reputation which
the regiment had acquired, with which he identified himself; even
the recruits possessed the same _esprit de corps_. After the
capture of Gueldermalsen a young soldier, named Sullivan, struck
the butt-end of his musket against a cask, when the musket went
off, and the ball passed through the soldier's body. He instantly
called to Lieutenant Graves, and said, "I hope, Sir, you will let
my friends know that I always behaved as became a good soldier,"
and immediately expired.

[12] Captain Jones, speaking of the conduct of the FOURTEENTH,
Twenty-seventh, and Twenty-eighth Regiments, at Gueldermalsen,
states in his _Journal_, "These regiments behaved with their usual
gallantry, and faced every danger with that cheerfulness and
perseverance which has peculiarly distinguished them."

[13] Sir Ralph Abercromby entertained a high opinion of the
FOURTEENTH; in the West Indies he always landed with the flank
companies, and the regiment furnished a corporal's guard at his
quarters. When he was appointed to the command of the troops in the
Mediterranean, with whom he proceeded to Egypt, he wrote to Captain
Graves, stating, "I regret extremely that I cannot take you with
me, as I intended, having found all my staff appointed when I got
to London." He afterwards added, with great pleasantry, "I also
greatly regret that the FOURTEENTH are not on the expedition, as I
do not think any service can go on well without them."

[14] "It is peculiarly incumbent upon the Lieutenant-General to
notice the vigorous attack made by the second battalion of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel Nicolls, which drove the
enemy out of the village on the left, of which he had possessed
himself."--_General Orders._

[15] "The gallant FOURTEENTH proceeded to scour the ramparts, and
the capture of the Sultan rendered the victory complete."--_London
Gazette._

[16] Colonel John M'Combe died at Calcutta on the 12th October,
1828.

[17] A brigantine, having on board the head-quarters of the
regiment, with six officers, one hundred and eight soldiers, and
thirty women, under Lieut.-Colonel Everard, C.B., K.H., was wrecked
on the rocks off Guadaloupe, before daylight on Christmas day; but
the inhabitants came to their aid in boats, and no lives were lost.

  OF

  THE FOURTEENTH,

  OR

  BUCKINGHAM REGIMENT

  OF

  FOOT.


SIR EDWARD HALES, BARONET.

_Appointed 22nd June, 1685._

This officer was the son of Sir Edward Hales, of Woodchurch, in the
county of Kent, who was a distinguished loyalist in the reigns of
Charles I. and Charles II., and being forced to flee from England
for his loyal attempts during the rebellion, he died in France a
few years after the restoration in 1660.

EDWARD HALES succeeded, on the decease of his father, to the
family estate at Woodchurch, and to the dignity of a Baronet; and
when the Court began to evince a disposition to favour Papacy, he
changed his religion from Protestant to Roman Catholic. He was
in great favour with King James II., and having raised a company
of foot for the service of that monarch, in June, 1685, he was
appointed colonel of a regiment, which is now the FOURTEENTH FOOT.
He was also constituted a member of the privy council, one of the
lords of the Admiralty, deputy governor of the cinque ports, and
lieutenant-governor of the Tower of London. Being unable, from
his religion, to take the required oaths on appointment to the
colonelcy of his regiment, he was prosecuted and convicted at
Rochester assizes; but he moved the case to the Court of King's
Bench, pleaded the King's dispensation and had judgment in his
behalf:--eleven out of the twelve judges being of opinion that the
King might dispense in that case.

SIR EDWARD HALES was in the King's confidence; and at the
Revolution, in 1688, he was employed to make arrangements for His
Majesty's flight to France. On the night of the 10th of December,
Sir Edward, with the quarter-master of his regiment, Edward
Syng[18], quitted Whitehall Palace with the King--proceeded in a
hackney coach to Horse-ferry, crossed the Thames in a boat, and
continued their flight in disguise to Feversham, where they went
on board of the Custom-House hoy, designing to cross the channel
to France; but they were suspected of being Popish priests, and
were apprehended on board the vessel by the country people. The
King being afterwards recognised, he was induced to return to
London; but he subsequently escaped from Rochester and proceeded to
France. Sir Edward Hales attempted to conceal himself, to escape
the fury of the populace, who were enraged against him for changing
his religion, and at the time he was apprehended at Feversham the
country people were plundering his house, killing his deer, and
wantonly destroying his property in Kent.

He was detained in custody, and afterwards confined in the Tower of
London for eighteen months; on his release he proceeded to France,
and he was at La Hogue ready to embark for England when Admiral
Russel defeated the French fleet. His eldest son served in King
James's army in Ireland, and was killed at the battle of the Boyne.

While in France, Sir Edward Hales was created by King James, EARL
OF TENTERDEN, in Kent. He died in France in 1695, and was buried in
the church of St. Sulpice in Paris.


WILLIAM BEVERIDGE.

_Appointed 31st December, 1688._

WILLIAM BEVERIDGE served under the Prince of Orange in the
Netherlands, in one of the British regiments in the service of the
States-General of Holland; and at the Revolution, in 1688, His
Highness promoted him to the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Regiment
of Foot. He commanded the regiment nearly four years; and was
killed in a duel with one of his captains, on the 14th of November,
1692.


JOHN TIDCOMB.

_Appointed 14th November, 1692._

This officer entered the army in the reign of King James II.,
and was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Thirteenth Foot, on
the 31st of December, 1688. He served under Major-General Mackay
in Scotland, and displayed great gallantry at the battle of
Killicrankie: he also served under King William III., in Ireland,
and was at the battle of the Boyne. He returned to England soon
afterwards; but accompanied the expedition to Ireland, under
Lieutenant-General the Earl of Marlborough, (afterwards the
celebrated John Duke of Marlborough,) and was at the capture of
Cork and Kinsale, and also in several skirmishes. His excellent
conduct on all occasions was rewarded with the colonelcy of the
FOURTEENTH Foot, in 1692: he afterwards served in the Netherlands,
was at the battle of Landen, and was engaged in the siege of
Namur. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, in 1703;
to that of major-general, on the 1st of January, 1704; and to
lieutenant-general, on the 1st of January, 1707. He died at Bath,
in June, 1713.


JASPER CLAYTON.

_Appointed 15th June, 1713._

JASPER CLAYTON obtained a commission in the army on the 24th of
June, 1695, and afterwards acquired great celebrity as a gallant
and meritorious officer. He served under King William until the
peace of Ryswick, in 1697. He also served under the great Duke
of Marlborough, in the reign of Queen Anne; and was appointed
lieutenant-colonel of the Eleventh Foot, with which he served in
Spain. His regiment suffered severely at the battle of Almanza, in
1707, and he returned with it to England in 1708, to recruit. In
1709, he served in Flanders, and distinguished himself at the siege
of Mons, where he was wounded[19]. He also served at the forcing of
the French lines, in 1710, and was rewarded with the colonelcy of a
newly-raised regiment of foot, on the 8th of December of that year.
In 1711 he served in the disastrous expedition against Quebec, and
his regiment had three officers and seventy-one soldiers drowned in
the river St. Lawrence, then called the river of Canada.

At the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, his regiment was disbanded;
and in June of the same year, he was appointed colonel of the
FOURTEENTH Foot. He served in Scotland under the Duke of Argyle,
during the rebellion of the Earl of Mar, and commanded a brigade
at the battle of Dumblain, on the 13th of November, 1715. He
was subsequently appointed lieutenant-governor of Gibraltar; he
commanded the troops in that fortress when it was besieged by the
Spaniards, in 1727, and his conduct in the successful defence
of that important place, called forth the approbation of his
sovereign and country. The rank of major-general was conferred on
this excellent officer, on the 2nd of November, 1735; and that of
lieutenant-general, on the 2nd of July, 1739. In 1743, he served
under King George II. in Germany; and highly distinguished himself
at the battle of Dettingen, on the 16th of June in that year.
He was killed as he was giving orders for the artillery to play
upon the bridge as the French retreated, and his fall was equally
regretted by his sovereign, the officers, and soldiers of the army.
He was interred with military honors in the chapel of Prince George
of Hesse, at Hanau.


JOSEPH PRICE.

_Appointed 22nd June, 1743._

JOSEPH PRICE obtained a commission of ensign in a regiment of
foot in 1706; and subsequently rose to the rank of captain and
lieutenant-colonel in the First Foot Guards. In January, 1741,
he was promoted to the colonelcy of the Fifty-seventh (now
Forty-sixth) regiment, which was then first raised; and in 1743 he
was removed to the FOURTEENTH Foot. He was promoted to the rank of
brigadier-general on the 6th of June, 1745. During the campaign of
1747, he commanded a brigade of infantry in the Netherlands, under
His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland. At the battle of Val,
on the 2nd of July of that year, he highly distinguished himself.
His brigade was posted in the village of Val, and his gallantry
during the action was commended by the Duke of Cumberland in his
public despatch. He died in November of the same year, at Breda, in
Holland.


THE HONORABLE WILLIAM HERBERT.

_Appointed 1st December, 1747._

THE HONORABLE WILLIAM HERBERT, fifth son of Thomas, eighth Earl
of Pembroke, and father of Henry, first Earl of Caernarvon, was
appointed to a commission in the army on the 1st of May, 1722.
He was promoted on the 15th December, 1738, to the commission
of captain and lieutenant-colonel in the First Foot Guards; and
in December, 1747, to the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Foot. In
January, 1753, he was removed to the Second Dragoon Guards. He was
subsequently advanced to the rank of major-general: he was groom of
the bedchamber to King George II., and a member of parliament for
Wilton, in Wiltshire. He died on the 31st of March, 1757.


EDWARD BRADDOCK.

_Appointed 17th February, 1753._

EDWARD BRADDOCK was appointed ensign in the Second Foot Guards on
the 11th October, 1710; lieutenant of the grenadier company in
1716[20]; captain and lieutenant-colonel in 1736; major in 1743;
and was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the same regiment
on the 21st of November, 1745. In 1753 he was appointed to the
colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Foot; in the following year he was
promoted major-general, and sent with a body of troops to North
America; and in 1755 he was commander-in-chief in that country.
Having completed arrangements for opening the campaign against the
French, who had made aggressions on the British territory, he took
the field with a body of regular troops, provincials, and Indians;
and on the 9th of July, while marching with twelve hundred men
through the woods towards Fort du Quesne, he was suddenly attacked
by a body of French and Indians, who had concealed themselves
behind the trees and bushes, and his men were put into some
confusion. "He exerted himself to remedy this disaster as much as
man could do, and, after having had five horses killed under him,
he was shot through the arm and through the lungs, of which he died
four days afterwards[21]."


THOMAS FOWKE.

_Appointed 12th November, 1755._

This officer had been upwards of fifty years in the army when he
was appointed to the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH Foot, his first
commission being dated the 25th of May, 1705. After serving the
Crown fifteen years, he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy
of the Seventh Dragoons, by commission dated the 25th of June,
1720. In January, 1741, he was promoted to the colonelcy of
the Fifty-fourth (now Forty-third) regiment, which was then

general officer were dated,--brigadier-general, 1st June, 1745;
major-general, 18th of September, 1747; and lieutenant-general,
30th of April, 1754. He was governor of Gibraltar in 1756, when the
island of Minorca, which was then subject to the British Crown, was
attacked by the French; and having disobeyed the directions, which
he received from the Secretary at War, to send a reinforcement to
that island, he was tried by a general court-martial, and sentenced
to be suspended for nine months; but the King, George II., directed
that he should be dismissed from the service.


CHARLES JEFFERIES.

_Appointed 7th September, 1756._

After a progressive service in the subordinate commissions, this

Royal American regiment, now the Sixtieth, or King's Royal Rifle
Corps. At this period he was with the Thirty-fourth regiment at
the island of Minorca, which was soon afterwards attacked by the
French, and he signalized himself in the defence of Port Mahon,
particularly in repulsing an attack on the place by storm, on
which occasion he was taken prisoner. His gallantry was shortly
afterwards rewarded with the colonelcy of the FOURTEENTH regiment.
He was promoted to the rank of major-general on the 27th of June,
1759. He died in 1765.


THE HONORABLE WILLIAM KEPPEL.

_Appointed 31st May, 1765._

THE HONORABLE WILLIAM KEPPEL, fourth son of William-Anne, second
Earl of Albemarle, was appointed captain and lieutenant-colonel in
the First Foot Guards on the 28th of April, 1750; and gentleman

following year, to the colonelcy of the Fifty-sixth Foot. In the
succeeding spring he proceeded with his regiment on an expedition
against the Havannah, with the local rank of major-general. In
August the Havannah capitulated, when he took possession of the
fort La Punta; and being afterwards left commander-in-chief at that
station, he re-delivered the city to the Spaniards according to the
conditions of the Treaty of Peace in 1763. He was promoted to the
rank of major-general on the 10th of July, 1762; was removed from
the colonelcy of the Fifty-sixth to the FOURTEENTH Foot in 1765;
and was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general in May, 1772. In

SIR HARRY CALVERT, BARONET, G.C.B.

_Appointed 8th February, 1806._

SIR HARRY CALVERT, Baronet, was appointed second lieutenant in
the Twenty-third, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, in April, 1778; he was
several months at the Royal Military College at Woolwich, and
proceeding to North America in the following year, he joined
his regiment, which was then employed on the outpost duty of
the army. In December, 1779, he served with his regiment in the
expedition, under Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton, to South
Carolina, and was at the siege and capture of Charlestown. He
afterwards served under the Marquis Cornwallis, and shared in all
the difficulties, dangers, and privations, in the campaigns of
the southern provinces, until the siege of York Town, when the
Marquis Cornwallis was forced to surrender, with the troops under
his command, to General Washington. He remained a prisoner of war
from October, 1781, until the peace in 1783, when he proceeded with
his regiment to New York. In the early part of 1784 he returned
to England, when he procured permission to pass the remainder of
the year on the Continent. In October, 1786, he purchased the
command of a company in his regiment, with which he did duty
until the spring of 1790, when he exchanged into the Coldstream
Guards. On the breaking out of the war of the French revolution, in
1793, he proceeded with the brigade of Foot Guards, commanded by
Major-General (afterwards Lord) Lake, to Holland, and when the Duke
of York assumed the command of the British and Hanoverian troops in
Flanders, Captain Calvert was nominated one of His Royal Highness's
aides-de-camp. After serving in this capacity until the surrender
of Valenciennes, he was sent to England with the account of that
event, on which occasion King George III. was pleased to confer on
him the rank of major. He obtained the rank of lieutenant-colonel
in December, 1793, by the purchase of a company in the Coldstream
Guards. He served with the allied army during the year 1794, and
returned to England on the recall of the British troops early
in 1795. In May of that year he was employed on a confidential
mission to the court of Berlin; and in 1796 he was appointed Deputy
Adjutant-General to the Forces: he obtained the rank of colonel in
June 1797, and in 1799 he was appointed to the lieutenant-colonelcy
of the Sixty-third Regiment.

On the 9th of January, 1799, His Majesty was pleased to appoint
Colonel CALVERT to the important situation of ADJUTANT-GENERAL TO
THE FORCES, in which capacity he was enabled to perform important
and valuable services to the crown and to the country, during one
of the most eventful periods in the history of Great Britain.
In August, 1800 he was nominated to the colonelcy of the Fifth
West India regiment; in 1803 he was promoted to the rank of
major-general; in 1806 he was removed to the FOURTEENTH Foot, and
in 1810 he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general.

At the period of his appointment to the high and important
station of Adjutant-General of the Forces, the want of efficient
regulations, and of an adherence to a system founded on principles
calculated to promote the advantage of every branch of service,
was felt by all persons called upon to take a part in the concerns
of the army, and serious inconvenience was experienced from the
absence of such a system by His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
who, at two different periods, had to contend against powerful
continental armies, with troops, though eminently brave, and
endued with the true spirit of their profession, yet not formed
upon sound general principles of discipline. His Royal Highness,
being appointed Commander-in-Chief, applied himself with great
diligence to the correction of abuses, and to the improvement of
the condition of the army in every particular: and his efforts,
which were honoured with the encouragement and approbation of
His Majesty, were ably seconded by his staff officers, who were
judiciously selected to carry his views into effect; the ultimate
accomplishment of these objects reflected the highest credit on
those who planned, and on those who executed measures which have
conduced to the safety and glory of the United Kingdom and of its
numerous colonial possessions. Among these officers, SIR HARRY
CALVERT held a distinguished station. As Adjutant-General, the
discipline, equipment, and efficiency of the army came under his
superintendence, and to improve and perfect these, he devoted
his best energies and unwearied attention. The general orders
of the army, in the successive editions which were brought
forward from the year 1799, afford abundant proofs of the value
of his labours, in the numerous and excellent regulations made
from time to time for the better government of the army. In the
_clothing_, _messing_, _equipment_, and every other branch of
the interior economy, improvements were introduced to promote
the health and comfort of the soldier, and the efficiency of
corps; and the establishment of _confidential inspection reports_
facilitated the accomplishment of these objects, by furnishing
the Commander-in-Chief, and the authorities under him, with
the means of forming a correct judgment of the state of each
corps in all its details,--of correcting what was wrong,--of
supplying what was deficient, and of ascertaining the merits
and capabilities of the officers. The energies of his mind were
also directed to the improvement of the _morale_, as well as to
ameliorate the _materiel_ of the army. Being a man of high and
sensitive honor himself, he wished to inspire all his brother
officers with the same sentiments, by impressing them with a just
idea of what they owed to themselves, both as individuals, and
as members of the profession of arms. Conscious that no man can
be truly respectable who does not respect himself, he was always
anxious to uphold and encourage this principle; in accordance
with which, he was particularly careful to afford every officer
charged with misconduct the fullest opportunity of explanation,
and, in conveying disapprobation or censure, he avoided the use
of terms calculated to affect the officer's personal feelings,
or to degrade him in his own estimation: his verbal intercourse
was conducted on the same principle. Such was the kindness of his
look and demeanour, and the courtesy of his language, that it was
impossible to offer him any personal disrespect; and with whatever
sentiments a gentleman might have approached him in his official
capacity, he could retire with those only of respect and esteem. To
the officers of his own department, who were in daily intercourse
with him, his orders were conveyed in the form of requests; and
the urbanity of his manners, tempered with self-respect, ensured
prompt and cheerful co-operation. In so extensive a branch of the
service, the preparation of many documents was necessarily confided
to assistants, and the alterations which suggested themselves
to his refined discrimination, were proposed with delicacy,--a
trait of character grateful to the feelings of his subordinates,
and remembered with emotions of respect constantly increased by
continued intercourse. In 1807, when the _recruiting_ of the
army was placed under his superintendence, he applied himself
successfully to the improvement of that branch of the service.
He interested himself in the _Royal Military Asylum_, and in the
establishment of _regimental schools_; the condition of _general
hospitals_ also engaged his attention,--he visited them all in
1814, and suggested many improvements in their conduct and
management. The _invalid_ and the _pensioner_ found a friend and
protector in him, and the representations of a discharged private
soldier were received and considered with the same care as those
of the higher grades of the service. In this, and in every other
respect, he acted in accordance with the desires of the DUKE OF
YORK, whose innate goodness of heart, and natural generosity and
condescension, led him to promote and encourage every species of
kindness to the humblest members of the profession to which he was
so devotedly attached; and SIR HARRY CALVERT was the faithful organ
of His Royal Highness's benevolent intentions, delighting in the
good he was thus enabled to effect.

Having conducted, in conjunction with the able officers associated
with him in the other military departments, the details of the
British army, when it was on a scale of magnitude surpassing
anything previously known, and through the whole course of the most
tremendous contest in which the nation ever was engaged, and having
witnessed victory achieved, by the valour and discipline of the
troops under their matchless chief, with the glorious termination
of the war, he was rewarded with the dignity of BARONET, in
October, 1818; and in the beginning of the year 1820, he retired
from that high situation which he had so long and so ably filled,
carrying with him the cordial good wishes of every rank. He had
previously been appointed lieutenant-governor of Chelsea Hospital;
honored with the dignity of Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath,
and Grand Cross of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order; and in
1826, he was promoted to the rank of general. He died suddenly of a
fit of apoplexy, while on a visit with his family at Claydon Hall,
in Buckinghamshire, on the 3rd of September, 1826.

1794. He commanded the regiment during its retreat through Holland,
and in the attack of the French post at Gueldermalsen, on the
8th of January, 1795, he received a wound in the shoulder which
deprived him of the use of his right arm. He was appointed governor
of Tynemouth and Clifford's fort, in 1797; lieutenant-governor
of Edinburgh Castle, in 1798; and deputy adjutant-general to the
expedition to Holland, in 1799. He was promoted to the rank of
colonel in the army, on the 1st of January, 1800; and to the
colonelcy of the Fifth West India Regiment, on the 30th of October,
1806. In April, 1808, he was further promoted to the rank of
major-general. In April, 1813, he was removed to the colonelcy of
the Forty-seventh Regiment; and in June of the same year, he was
advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general. He obtained the rank
of general, on the 22nd of July, 1830; and the colonelcy of the
FOURTEENTH Regiment, in 1835. He was constituted a Knight Grand
Cross of the Order of the Bath: he was lieutenant-governor of the
Royal Hospital at Chelsea: he died on the 19th of May, 1837.

Authentic accounts of the actions of the great, the valiant, the
loyal, have always been of paramount interest with a brave and
civilized people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes,
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood "firm as the
rocks of their native shore;" and when half the world has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,--victories so complete and surprising, gained
by our countrymen, our brothers, our fellow-citizens in arms,--a
record which revives the memory of the brave, and brings their
gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove acceptable to the
public.--_Extract from the General Preface._

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
